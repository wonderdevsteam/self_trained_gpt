That doesn't seem right.\n\nNo, it's true, I did a series of experiments when I was 12.\n\nMy father broke his clavicle.\n\nIs that why they sent you to boarding school?\n\nNo. That was a result of my work with lasers.\n\nNew neighbor?\n\nEvidently.\n\nSignificant improvement over the old neighbor. with a skin condition?\n\nYes, she is.\n\nOh, hi.\n\nHi.\n\nWe don't mean to interrupt.\n\nWe live across the hall.\n\nOh, that's nice.\n\nWe don't live together. I mean...\n\nWe live together, but in separate, heterosexual bedrooms.\n\nOkay, well...\n\nGuess I'm your new neighbor. Penny.\n\nLeonard. Sheldon.\n\nHi.\n\nWell...\n\nWelcome to the building.\n\nThank you.\n\nMaybe we can have coffee sometime.\n\nGreat.\n\nWell... bye.\n\nBye.\n\nShould we have invited her for lunch?\n\nWe're gonna start season two of Battlestar Galactica.\n\nWe already watched the season two DVDs.\n\nNot with commentary.\n\nI think we should be good neighbors and invite her over, make her feel welcome.\n\nWe never invited\n\nLouie-slash-Louise over.\n\nAnd that was wrong of us.\n\nWe need to widen our circle.\n\nI have a very wide circle.\n\nI have 212 friends on MySpace.\n\nYes, and you've never met one of them.\n\nThat's the beauty of it.\n\nI'm gonna invite her over.\n\nWe'll have a nice meal and... chat.\n\nChat? We don't chat.\n\nAt least not offline.\n\nIt's not difficult.\n\nYou just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response.\n\nTo what end?\n\nHi... again.\n\nHi.\n\nAnyway...\n\nWe brought home Indian food.\n\nAnd...\n\nI know that moving can be stressful, and I find that when I'm undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect.\n\nAlso, curry is a natural laxative, and I don't have to tell you that, you know, a clean colon is just... one less thing to worry about.\n\nI'm no expert, but I believe in the context of a luncheon invitation, you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements.\n\nYou're inviting me over to eat?\n\nOh, that's so nice.\n\nI'd love to.\n\nGreat.\n\nSo, what do you guys do for fun around here?\n\nToday we tried masturbating for money.\n\nSeason 1 Episode 1:\n\nPilot\n\nOkay, make yourself at home.\n\nThank you.\n\nYou're very welcome.\n\nThis looks like some serious stuff.\n\nLeonard, did you do this?\n\nActually, that's my work.\n\nYeah. Well, it's just some quantum mechanics with a little string theory doodling around the edges.\n\nThat part there, that's just a joke.\n\nIt's a spoof of the\n\nBorn-Oppenheimer approximation.\n\nSo you're like one of those\n\nBeautiful Mind genius guys.\n\nThis is really impressive.\n\nI have a board.\n\nIf you like boards, this is my board.\n\nHoly smokes.\n\nIf by \"holy smokes\", you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT, sure.\n\nWhat?\n\nCome on.\n\nWho hasn't seen this differential below \"Here I sit, broken-hearted\"?\n\nAt least I didn't have to invent 26 dimensions just to make the math come out.\n\nI didn't invent them. They're there.\n\nIn what universe?\n\nIn all of them... that is the point.\n\nDo you guys mind if I start?\n\nPenny... that's where l sit.\n\nSo, sit next to me.\n\nNo... I sit there.\n\nWhat's the difference?\n\nWhat's the difference?\n\nHere we go.\n\nIn the winter, that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration\n\nIn the summer, it's directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there.\n\nIt faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide as to create a parallax distortion.\n\nI could go on, but I think\n\nI've made my point.\n\nDo you want me to move?\n\nWell...\n\nJust sit somewhere else.\n\nFine.\n\nSheldon, sit!\n\nWell, this is nice.\n\nWe don't have a lot of company over.\n\nThat's not true. Koothrappali and Wolowitz come over all the time.\n\nI know, but...\n\nTuesday night, we played Klingon Boggle till 1:00 a.m.\n\nYeah, I remember.\n\nDon't say we don't have company.\n\nSorry.\n\nThat has negative social implications.\n\nI said I'm sorry!\n\nSo...\n\nKlingon Boggle?\n\nYeah. It's like regular Boggle, but... in Klingon.\n\nThat's probably enough about us.\n\nSo, tell us about you.\n\nMe? Okay.\n\nI'm a Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know.\n\nYes. It tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the sun's apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality.\n\nParticipate in the what?\n\nI think what Sheldon's trying to say is that Sagittarius wouldn't have been our first guess.\n\nYeah, a lot of people think I'm a water sign.\n\nOkay, let's see, what else.\n\nI'm a vegetarian.\n\nExcept for fish.\n\nAnd the occasional steak. I love steak!\n\nWell, that's interesting.\n\nLeonard can't process corn.\n\nWell... do you have some sort of a job?\n\nI'm a waitress at The Cheesecake Factory.\n\nI love cheesecake.\n\nYou're lactose-intolerant.\n\nI don't eat it...\n\nI just think it's a good idea.\n\nAnyways, I'm also writing a screenplay.\n\nIt's about this sensitive girl who comes to L.A. from Lincoln, Nebraska, to be an actress and winds up a waitress at The Cheesecake Factory.\n\nSo, it's based on your life.\n\nNo, I'm from Omaha.\n\nIf that was movie, I would go see it.\n\nI know, right?\n\nOkay, let's see, what else...\n\nGuess that's about it.\n\nThat's the story of Penny.\n\nIt sounds wonderful.\n\nIt was.\n\nUntil I fell in love with a jerk!\n\nWhat's happening?\n\nGod, you know, as long as high school.\n\nIt took you 4 years to get through high school?\n\nIt just... I can't believe\n\nI trusted him.\n\nShould I say something?\n\nI feel like I should say something.\n\nYou? No, you'll only make it worse.\n\nYou want to know the most pathetic part?\n\nEven though I hate his lying, cheating guts...\n\nI still love him.\n\nIs that crazy?\n\nNo, it's not crazy. It's a...\n\nIt's a paradox.\n\nParadoxes are part of nature.\n\nThink about light.\n\nIf you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double-slit experiments, but then along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles, too.\n\nWell, I didn't make it worse.\n\nI'm so sorry. I'm such a mess.\n\nOn top of everything else,\n\nI'm all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn't even work.\n\nOur shower works.\n\nReally? Would it be totally weird if I used it?\n\nYes.\n\nNo.\n\nIt's right down the hall.\n\nThanks.\n\nYou guys are really sweet.\n\nWell, this is an interesting development.\n\nHow so?\n\nIt has been some time since we've had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.\n\nThat's not true.\n\nRemember at Thanksgiving, my grandmother with Alzheimer's had that episode?\n\nPoint taken.\n\nIt has been some time since we've had a woman take her clothes off, after which we didn't want to rip our eyes out.\n\nThe worst part was watching her carve that turkey.\n\nSo what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?\n\nExcuse me?\n\nThat woman is not going to have sex with you.\n\nI'm not trying to have sex with her.\n\nGood. Then you won't be disappointed.\n\nWhat makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me?\n\nI'm a male and she's a female.\n\nYes, but not of the same species.\n\nI'm not going to engage in hypotheticals here.\n\nI'm just trying to be a good neighbor.\n\nOf course.\n\nThat's not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop, that I wouldn't participate.\n\nHowever briefly.\n\nDo you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?\n\nIt's Darth Vader shampoo.\n\nLuke Skywalker's the conditioner.\n\nWait till you see this.\n\nIt's fantastic, unbelievable.\n\nSee what?\n\nIt's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.\n\nThis isn't a good time.\n\nIt's before he became a creepy computer voice.\n\nThat's great. You guys have to go.\n\nWhy?\n\nIt's just not a good time.\n\nLeonard has a lady over.\n\nYeah, right... your grandmother back in town?\n\nAnd she's not a lady.\n\nShe's just a new neighbor.\n\nHang on, there really is a lady here?\n\nAnd you want us out because you're anticipating coitus?\n\nI'm not anticipating coitus.\n\nSo she's available for coitus?\n\nCan we please just stop saying \"coitus\"?\n\nTechnically, that would be\"coitus interruptus. \"\n\nHey, is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower...?\n\nHi. Sorry.\n\nHello.\n\nHoward Wolowitz,\n\nCaltech department of applied physics.\n\nYou may be familiar with some of my work.\n\nIt's currently orbiting\n\nJupiter's largest moon taking high-resolution digital photographs.\n\nPenny. I work at The Cheesecake Factory.\n\nI'll show you the trick with the shower.\n\nI'm sorry?\n\nIt's French for \"good shower. \"\n\nIt's a sentiment I can express in six languages.\n\nSave it for your blog, Howard.\n\nAll right, there it goes.\n\nIt sticks. I'm sorry.\n\nOkay, thanks.\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nYou're just gonna to step right... Okay, I'll...\n\nHey, Leonard?\n\nThe hair products are Sheldon's.\n\nCan I ask you a favor?\n\nA favor?\n\nSure, you can ask me a favor.\n\nI would do you a favor for you.\n\nIt's okay if you say no.\n\nI'll probably say yes.\n\nIt's just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you just met.\n\nI really think we should examine the chain of causality here.\n\nMust we?\n\nEvent A...\n\nA beautiful woman stands naked in our shower.\n\nEvent B... we drive halfway across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman's ex-boyfriend.\n\nQuery... on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events?\n\nShe asked me to do her a favor, Sheldon.\n\nYes, well, that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause.\n\nWhich is?\n\nYou think with your penis.\n\nThat's a biological impossibility.\n\nAnd you didn't have to come.\n\nRight, I could have stayed behind and watch Wolowitz try to hit on Penny in Russian, Arabic and Farsi.\n\nWhy can't she get her own TV?\n\nCome on, you know how it is with breakups.\n\nNo, I don't... and neither do you.\n\nI broke up with Joyce Kim.\n\nYou did not break up with Joyce Kim.\n\nShe defected to North Korea.\n\nTo mend her broken heart.\n\nThis situation is much less complicated.\n\nThere's some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV.\n\nShe just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.\n\nSo we get to have a scene with him?\n\nNo, there's not going to be a scene.\n\nThere's two of us and one of him.\n\nLeonard, the two of us can't even carry a TV.\n\nSo, you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon at the university?\n\nI'm sorry, do you speak English?\n\nHe speaks English.\n\nHe just can't speak to women.\n\nReally? Why?\n\nHe's kind of a nerd.\n\nJuice box?\n\nI'll do the talking.\n\nHi, I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.\n\nHello.\n\nWhat did I just--\n\nWe're here to pick up Penny's TV.\n\nOkay, thanks for you time.\n\nWe're not going to give up just like that.\n\nLeonard, the TV's in the building.\n\nWe've been denied access to the building, ergo, we are done.\n\nExcuse me. If I were to give up on the first little hitch,\n\nI never would have identified the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the Big Bang.\n\nMy apologies. What's your plan?\n\nIt's just a privilege to watch your mind at work.\n\nCome on, we have a combined IQ of 360.\n\nWe should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building.\n\nWhat do you think their combined IQ is?\n\nJust grab the door!\n\nThis is it.\n\nI'll do the talking.\n\nGood thinking.\n\nI'll just be the muscle.\n\nYeah?\n\nI'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.\n\nFrom the intercom.\n\nHow the hell did you get in the building?\n\nWe're scientists.\n\nTell him about our IQ.\n\nLeonard...\n\nWhat?\n\nMy mom bought me those pants.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nYou're going to have to call her.\n\nSheldon, I am so sorry\n\nI dragged you through this.\n\nIt's okay. It wasn't my first pantsing and it won't be my last.\n\nAnd you were right about my motives.\n\nI was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have someday led to sex.\n\nWell, you got me out of my pants.\n\nAnyway, I've learned my lesson.\n\nShe's out of my league,\n\nI'm done with her.\n\nGot my work, one day\n\nI'll win the Nobel Prize and then I'll die alone.\n\nDon't think like that.\n\nYou're not going to die alone.\n\nThank you, Sheldon.\n\nYou're a good friend.\n\nAnd you're certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize.\n\nThis is one of my favorite places to kick back after a quest.\n\nThey have a great house ale.\n\nCool tiger.\n\nYeah, I've had him since level ten.\n\nHis name is Buttons.\n\nAnyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest.\n\nThat sounds interesting.\n\nYou'll think about it?\n\nI don't think I'll be able to stop thinking about it.\n\nSmooth.\n\nWe're home.\n\nMy God, what happened?\n\nWell, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.\n\nI'm so sorry. I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn't be such an ass.\n\nNo, it was a valid hypothesis.\n\nThat was a valid...?\n\nWhat is happening to you?\n\nReally, thank you so much for going and trying, you're just...\n\nYou're so terrific. Really.\n\nWhy don't you put some clothes on,\n\nI'll get my purse, and dinner is on me, okay?\n\nReally? Great.\n\nThank you.\n\nYou're not done with her, are you?\n\nAre babies will be smart and beautiful.\n\nNot to mention imaginary.\n\nIs Thai food okay with you, Penny?\n\nSure.\n\nWe can't have Thai food, we had Indian for lunch.\n\nSo?\n\nThey're both curry-based cuisines.\n\nSo?\n\nIt would be gastronomically redundant.\n\nI can see we're going to have to spell out everything for this girl.\n\nAny ideas, Raj?\n\nTurn left on Lake Street and head up to Colorado.\n\nI know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke.\n\nThat sounds like fun.\n\nI don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole, but as far as the population of this car goes, you're a veritable mack daddy.\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "78c0cf56-dc76-4200-8fea-939c92a2e87f": {"__data__": {"id_": "78c0cf56-dc76-4200-8fea-939c92a2e87f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "19f524469747f65aefabfaf62936701086f0eb8b65e623ce1107bd3733c85b96", "text": "\n\nHere we go.\n\nPad thai, no peanuts.\n\nBut does it have peanut oil?\n\nI'm not sure.\n\nEveryone keep an eye on Howard in case he starts to swell up.\n\nSince it's not bee season, you can have my epinephrine.\n\nAre there any chopsticks.\n\nNo need.

How was work?\n\nYou know, it's a Cheesecake Factory.\n\nPeople order cheesecake and I bring it to them.\n\nSo you kind of act like a carbohydrate delivery system.\n\nYeah. Call it whatever you want,\n\nI get minimum wage.\n\nI was wondering if you could help me out with something.\n\nYes.\n\nGreat. I'm having some furniture delivered tomorrow and I may not be here, so...\n\nHello.\n\nI'm sorry?\n\nHaven't you ever been told how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?\n\nNo, I haven't.\n\nGet used to it.\n\nYeah.

Here's my spare key.\n\nThank you.\n\nPenny, wait.\n\nIf you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?\n\nA marathon?\n\nHow many Superman movies are there?\n\nYou're kidding, right?\n\nI do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman swooshes down and catches her. Which one was that?\n\nOne.\n\nYou realize that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.\n\nYes, I know, men can't fly.\n\nNo.\n\nLet's assume that they can.\n\nLois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second.\n\nSuperman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel.\n\nMiss Lane, who is now traveling at approximately 120 miles an hour, hits them and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces.\n\nUnless Superman matches her speed and decelerates.\n\nIn what space, sir?\n\nShe's two feet above the ground.\n\nFrankly, if he really loved her, he'd let her hit the pavement.\n\nIt'd be a more merciful death.\n\nExcuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that Superman's flight is a feat of strength.\n\nAre you listening  to yourself?\n\nIt is well established that his flight is a feat of strength.\n\nIt is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings, an ability he derives from exposure to Earth's yellow sun.\n\nAnd how does he fly at night?\n\nA combination of the moon's solar reflection and the energy-storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells.\n\nI'm just gonna go wash up.\n\nI have 2,600 comic books in there.\n\nI challenge you to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells.\n\nChallenge accepted.\n\nWe're locked out.\n\nAlso, the pretty girl left. o/~ Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state o/~ o/~ Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started...

physicists.\n\nWe are the intellectual descendants of Archimedes.\n\nGive me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the Earth.\n\nIt's just a matter of...\n\nI don't have this.\n\nArchimedes would be so proud.\n\nDo you have any ideas?\n\nYes, but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring.\n\nEasy... easy.\n\nNow we've got an inclined plane.\n\nThe force required to lift is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs, call it 30 degrees, so, about half.\n\nExactly half.\n\nExactly half.\n\nLet's push.\n\nSee, it's moving, this is easy.\n\nIt's all in the math.\n\nWhat's your formula

messy.\n\nThis is chaos.\n\nExcuse me.\n\nExplain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid.\n\nI'm just inferring this is a couch because the evidence suggests the coffee table is having a tiny garage sale.\n\nDid it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort, organize and label the entire world around them?\n\nNo.\n\nWell, they don't.\n\nHard as it may be for you to believe, most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fiber content.\n\nExcuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times.\n\nCome on, we should go.\n\nHang on.\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\nI'm straightening up.\n\nThis is not your home.\n\nThis is not anyone's home.\n\nThis is a swirling vortex of entropy.\n\nWhen the transvestite

stairs?\n\nNo. \"No\"?\n\nNo.\n\nNo.\n\nWell, we'll get out of your hair.\n\nOkay, great.\n\nThank you again.\n\nI just want you to know that you don't have to live like this.\n\nI'm here for you.\n\nWhat's he talking about?\n\nIt's a joke.\n\nI don't get it.\n\nYeah, he didn't tell it right.\n\nPenny's sleeping.\n\nAre you insane?\n\nYou can't just break into a woman's apartment in the middle of the night and clean.\n\nI had no choice.\n\nI couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room, and just outside our living room was that hallway, and immediately adjacent to the hallway was... this.\n\nDo you realize that if Penny wakes up, there is no reasonable explanation as to why we're here.\n\nI just gave you a reasonable explanation.\n\nNo, no, you gave me an explanation.\n\nIts reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers.\n\nDon't be ridiculous.\n\nI have no peers.\n\nWe have to get out of here.\n\nYou might want to speak in a lower register.\n\nWhat?\n\nEvolution has made women sensitive to high-pitched noises while they sleep so that they'll be roused by a crying baby.\n\nIf you want to avoid waking her, speak in a lower register.\n\nThat's ridiculous!\n\nNo. \"That's ridiculous.\"\n\nFine.\n\nI accept your premise.\n\nNow, please, let's go.\n\nI'm not leaving until I'm done.\n\nIf you have time to lean, you have time to clean.\n\nOh, what the hell.\n\nMorning.\n\nMorning.\n\nI have to say\n\nI slept splendidly.\n\nGranted, not long, but just deeply and well.\n\nI'm not surprised.\n\nA well-known folk cure for insomnia is to break in your neighbor's apartment and clean.\n\nSarcasm?\n\nYou think?\n\nGranted, my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox, but I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement to Penny's quality of life\n\nYou've convinced me.\n\nMaybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet.\n\nYou don't think that crosses a line?\n\nYes.\n\nFor God's sake, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth?\n\nYou have a sarcasm sign?\n\nNo, I do not have a sarcasm sign.\n\nDo you want some cereal?\n\nI feel so good today,\n\nI'm gonna choose from the low-fiber end of the shelf.\n\nHello, Honey Puffs.\n\nSon of a bitch!\n\nPenny's up.\n\nYou sick geeky bastards!\n\nHow did she know it was us?\n\nI may have left a suggested organizational schematic for her bedroom closet.\n\nGod, this is gonna be bad.\n\nGood-bye, Honey Puffs.\n\nHello, Big Bran.\n\nYou came into my apartment last night while I was sleeping?!\n\nYes, but only to clean.\n\nReally more to organize.\n\nYou're not actually dirty, per se.\n\nGive me back my key.\n\nI'm very, very sorry.\n\nDo you understand how creepy this is?\n\nOh, yes, we discussed it at length last night.\n\nIn my apartment, while I was sleeping?!\n\nAnd snoring. And that's probably just a sinus infection.\n\nBut it could be sleep apnea.\n\nYou might want to see an otolaryngologist.\n\nA throat doctor.\n\nAnd what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?\n\nDepending on the depth, that's either a... proctologist or a general surgeon.\n\nI think what you're feeling is perfectly valid and maybe a little bit later when you're feeling a little less... for lack of a better word-- violated, maybe we can talk about this some more.\n\nStay away from me.\n\nSure, that's another way to go.\n\nPenny, Penny!\n\nJust to clarify, because there will be a discussion when you leave, is your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you were sleeping, or do you also object to the imposition of a new organizational paradigm.\n\nWell, that was a little non-responsive.\n\nYou are going to march yourself over there right now and apologize.\n\nWhat's funny?\n\nThat wasn't sarcasm?\n\nBoy, you are all over the place this morning.\n\nI have a master's and two Ph.D.s,\n\nI should not have to do this.\n\nWhat?!\n\nI am truly sorry for what happened last night.\n\nI take full responsibility.\n\nAnd I hope that it won't color your opinion of Leonard, who is not only a wonderful guy, but also, I hear, a gentle and thorough lover.\n\nI did what I could.\n\nHey, Raj.\n\nHey, listen.\n\nI don't know if you heard about what happened last night. but I'm really upset about it.\n\nI mean, they just... they let themselves into my place and then they cleaned it.\n\nCan you even believe that?\n\nHow weird is that?\n\nYou know, where I come from, if someone comes into your house at night, you shoot. Okay?\n\nAnd you don't shoot to wound.\n\nI mean, all right, my sister shot her husband, but it was an accident, they were drunk.\n\nWait, what was I saying? with an Indian girl.</i> cultural background</i> the same lullabies my mother sang to me.</i>\n\nIt's obvious that they meant well, but...\n\nI'm having a really rough time.\n\nI broke up with my boyfriend and...\n\nJust because most of the men I've known in my life happen to be jerks, doesn't mean I should just assume Leonard and Sheldon are.\n\nRight?\n\nI should probably nod.</i>\n\nThat's exactly what I thought.\n\nThank you for listening.\n\nYou're a doll.\n\nTurn your pelvis.\n\nGrab a napkin, homie.\n\nYou just got served.\n\nIt's fine.You win.\n\nWhat's his problem?\n\nHis imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.\n\nBeen there.\n\nSorry I'm late, but I was in the hallway, chatting up Penny.\n\nReally? You, Rajesh\n\nKoothrappali, spoke to Penny?\n\nActually, I was less the chatter than the chat-ee.\n\nWhat did she say?\n\nIs she still mad at me?\n\nWell, she was upset at first, but probably because her sister shot somebody.\n\nBut then there was something about you, and then she hugged me.\n\nShe hugged you?\n\nHow'd she hug you?\n\nIs that her perfume I smell?\n\nIntoxicating, isn't it?\n\nHi.\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nHere's the thing. \"Just as Oppenheimer came to regret his contributions \"to the first atomic bomb, \"so too I regret my participation in what was, \"at the very least, an error in judgment. \"The hallmark of the great human experiment \"is the willingness to recognize one's mistakes. \"Some mistakes, such as\n\nMadam Curie's discovery of radium, \"turned out to have great scientific potential, \"even though she would later die a slow, painful death \"from radiation poisoning.\n\nAnother example, from the field of Ebola research...\"\n\nWe're okay.\n\nSix two inch dowels.\n\nCheck.\n\nOne package Phillips head screws.\n\nCheck.\n\nYou guys, seriously,\n\nI grew up on a farm, okay?\n\nI rebuilt a tractor engine when I was, like, 12.\n\nI think I can put together a cheap,\n\nSwedish media center.\n\nNo, please. We insist.\n\nIt's the least we can do, considering.\n\nConsidering what?\n\nHow great this place looks?\n\nOh, boy. I was afraid of this.\n\nWhat?\n\nThese instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components.\n\nThis, right here is why Sweden has no space program.\n\nWell, it looked pretty good in the store.\n\nIt is an inefficient design.\n\nFor example, she has a flat screen TV, which means all the space behind it is wasted.\n\nWe could put her stereo back there.\n\nAnd control it how?\n\nRun an infrared repeater.\n\nPhoto cell here, emitter here, easy-peasy.\n\nHow are you gonna cool it?\n\nHey, guys, I got this.\n\nHang on, Penny.\n\nHow about fans?\n\nHere and here.\n\nAlso inefficient, and might be loud.\n\nHow about liquid coolant?\n\nMaybe a little aquarium pump here, run some quarter-inch PVC...\n\nGuys, this is actually really simple.\n\nHold on, honey.\n\nMen at work.\n\nThe PVC comes down here.\n\nMaybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.\n\nYeah? Show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice, and an overflow reservoir.\n\nIf water's involved, we're gonna have to ground the crap out of the thing.\n\nIt's hot in here. I think\n\nI'll just take off all my clothes.\n\nOh, I've got it.\n\nWhat about if we replace panels A, B and F and crossbar H with aircraft-grade aluminum?\n\nRight. Then the entire thing is one heat sink.\n\nYou and Sheldon go to the junkyard and pick up\n\nRaj and I will get the oxyacetylene torch.\n\nMeet back here in an hour?\n\nDone.\n\nOkay, this place does look pretty good.\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "30864c69-ec1c-4895-b920-5bb2b6cf544c": {"__data__": {"id_": "30864c69-ec1c-4895-b920-5bb2b6cf544c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "d9bfe68e6bc4833af8ea3d08d8a286ad01340633a25af311cfde6b17390f70da", "text": "\n\nAlright, just a few more feet.\n\nAnd... here we are, gentlemen, the Gates of Elzebob.\n\nGood Lord.\n\nDon't panic.

About two seconds.\n\nAnyway, I was thinking more of a bio-social exploration with a neuro-chemical overlay.\n\nWait, are you asking me out?\n\nI was going to characterize it as the modification of our colleague-slash-friendship paradigm with the addition of a date-like component, but we don't need to quibble over terminology.\n\nWhat sort of experiment?\n\nThere's a generally accepted pattern in this area.\n\nI would pick you up, take you to a restaurant.\n\nThen we would see a movie, probably a romantic comedy featuring the talents of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock.\n\nInteresting.\n\nAnd would you agree that the primary way we would evaluate either the success or failure of the date would be based on the biochemical reaction during the good night kiss?\n\nHeart rate, pheromones, etc. Yes.\n\nWhy don't we just stipulate that the date goes well and move to the key variable?\n\nYou mean kiss you now?\n\nYes.\n\nCan you define the parameters of the kiss?\n\nClose-mouthed but romantic.\n\nMint?\n\nThank you.\n\nI count down from three?\n\nNo, I think it needs to be spontaneous.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nYou proposed the experiment.\n\nI think you should present your findings first.\n\nFair enough.\n\nOn the plus side, it was a good kiss.\n\nReasonable technique, no extraneous spittle.\n\nOn the other hand, no arousal.\n\nNone?\n\nNone.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nThank you.\n\nNone at all?\n\nSheldon, if you were a robot, and I knew and you didn't... ...would you want me to tell you?\n\nThat depends.\n\nWhen\n\nI learn that I'm a robot... will I be able to handle it?\n\nMaybe-- although the history of science fiction is not on your side.\n\nOkay, let me ask you this-- when I learn that I'm a robot, would I be bound by Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics?\n\nYou might be bound by them right now.\n\nThat's true.\n\nHave you ever harmed a human being or through inaction allowed a human being to come to harm?\n\nOf course not.\n\nHave you ever harmed yourself or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would have been endangered?\n\nWell, no.\n\nI smell robot.\n\nHey, what's going on?\n\nInternet's been down for half an hour.\n\nAlso, Sheldon may be a robot.\n\nSo how'd it go with Leslie?\n\nOh, we tried kissing, but the Earth didn't move.\n\nI mean, any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway.\n\nOh, I've seen that look before.\n\nThis is just going to be two weeks of moping and tedious emo songs and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats.\n\nI don't know if I can take it.\n\nYou could power down.\n\nAs usual, Wolowitz has the solution.\n\nI happen to know a place where there are plenty of eligible women and Leonard could have his pick.\n\nRemember the Latin hips.\n\nShoulders stay still, and... we sway.\n\nOne, two, three... ...five, six, seven.\n\nI think Mrs. Tishman's got her eye on you.\n\nI've been there.\n\nYou're in for a treat.\n\nOh, good Lord.\n\nGod, that's a good song.\n\nIf you're compiling a mix CD for a double suicide.\n\nOh, I hope that scratching post is for you.\n\nI know what you're thinking.\n\nI've taken your asthma into account.\n\nThere's a feline geneticist in San Diego who's developed the cutest little hypoallergenic calicos.\n\nListen to me...\n\nI've been thinking about names.\n\nI'm kind of torn between\n\nEinstein, Newton and Sergeant Fuzzy Boots.\n\nDo you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically altered cat?\n\nMaybe.\n\nIf it's a cute, little, cuddly cat.\n\nOh, come on. Leonard...\n\nThis is obviously about Penny.\n\nIt doesn't matter.\n\nThe woman's not interested in me.\n\nThe woman rejected me.\n\nLook,\n\nI think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble Telescope does of discovering at the center of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker.\n\nNevertheless,\n\nI do feel obligated to point out to you that she did not reject you.\n\nYou did not ask her out.\n\nYou're right.\n\nI didn't ask her out.\n\nI should ask her out.\n\nNo, no, that was not my point.\n\nMy point was don't buy a cat.\n\nNo, but you're right.\n\nI should march over there and ask her out.\n\nOh, goody, we're getting a cat.\n\nGood afternoon, Penny.\n\nSo, hi... hey.\n\nI was wondering if you had plans for dinner.\n\nYou mean dinner tonight?\n\nThere is an inherent ambiguity in the word \"dinner.\"\n\nTechnically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it's consumed.\n\nSo to clarify here, by dinner I mean supper.\n\nSupper?\n\nOr dinner.\n\nI was thinking 6:30 if you can go.\n\nOr a different time.\n\nReally?\n\nGreat.\n\nI like hanging out with you guys.\n\nUs guys?\n\nYeah, you know, Sheldon, Howard, Raj.\n\nWho all's coming?\n\nThey... might all be there.\n\nOr a subset of them might be there.\n\nAlgebraically speaking, there are too many unknowns.\n\nFor example,\n\nSheldon had Quiznos for lunch.\n\nSometimes he finds that filling, other times he doesn't.\n\nIt's no fault of Quiznos-- they have a varied menu.\n\nOkay, whatever.\n\nIt sounds like fun.\n\nGreat.\n\nDid we say a time?\n\nAnd that's still good?\n\nIt's fine. 'Cause it's not carved in stone.\n\nNo, 6:30's great.\n\nI'll get my chisel.\n\nWhy?\n\nTo... carve the...\n\nI'll see you at 6:30.\n\nHow do I look?\n\nCould you be more specific?\n\nCan you tell I'm perspiring a little?\n\nNo. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely.\n\nWhat time is your date?\n\nPerfect. That gives you two hours and 15 minutes for that dense molecular cloud of Aramis to dissipate.\n\nIs it too much?\n\nNot if you're a rugby team.\n\nIf it should ever come up, you didn't join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at Quiznos.\n\nWhy would I join you?\n\nNo reason.\n\nYou know what, maybe this isn't such a good idea.\n\nNo, well, now there's always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgment on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening.\n\nYou're right. Alcohol, poor judgment-- it could go well.\n\nThere is the other possibility,  that... this date kicks off a rather unpleasant 6 months of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall, until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code.\n\nYou could've stopped at \"it could go well.\"\n\nIf I could've, I would've.\n\nI mean, I'm a perfectly nice guy.\n\nThere's no reason we couldn't go and have a lovely dinner, maybe take a walk afterwards, talk about things we have in common.\n\nYou love pottery?\n\nI love pottery!\n\nThere's a pause, we both know what's happening.\n\nI lean in, we kiss.\n\nIt's a little tentative at first, but then I realize she's kissing me back.\n\nShe's biting my lower lip!\n\nShe wants me!\n\nThis thing is going the distance!\n\nWe're going to have sex!\n\nOh, God, oh, my God!\n\nIs the sex starting now?\n\nI'm having a panic attack.\n\nWell then... calm down.\n\nIf I could,\n\nI wouldn't be having a panic...\n\nThat's why they call it a panic attack.\n\nSit down.\n\nYeah, sit down. Now close your eyes.\n\nWhy?\n\nJust do it.\n\nNow try to increase your alpha wave activity.\n\nWhat?!\n\nIt's a biofeedback technique.\n\nIt's relaxation through brain wave manipulation.\n\nI read a paper about it in Journal of American Neuroscience.\n\nIt was a little sparsely sourced, but I think the basic science is valid.\n\nI probably have it here somewhere.\n\nWho am I kidding?\n\nI can't go through with this.\n\nYou need to call her and cancel.\n\nMe?\n\nYes.\n\nWhat should I tell her?\n\nI don't know. Tell her I'm sick.\n\nNot an illness that will make her want to take care of me, but nothing so critical that she'll feel uncomfortable going out with me if I want to try this again.\n\nGot it.\n\nSo I'm assuming nothing venereal?\n\nI'll just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy and haven't quite bounced back.\n\nGive me the phone.\n\nI thought you wanted to cancel.\n\nI can't, because if I don't show up she'll still be expecting you.\n\nWhy would she be expecting me?\n\nStop asking me all these questions.\n\nI need to take another shower.\n\nSo are the rest of the guys meeting us here?\n\nOh, yeah... no.\n\nIt turns out that Raj and Howard had to work, and Sheldon... had a colonoscopy and he hasn't quite bounced back yet.\n\nMy uncle just had a colonoscopy.\n\nYou're kidding.\n\nThen that's something we have in common.\n\nHow?\n\nWe both have people in our lives who... want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud.\n\nSo what's new in the world of physics?\n\nNothing.\n\nReally? Nothing?\n\nWell, with the exception of string theory, not much has happened since the 1930s.\n\nAnd you can't prove string theory.\n\nAt best you can say, \"Hey, look, my idea has an internal logical consistency.\"\n\nWell, I'm sure things will pick up.\n\nWhat's new at the Cheesecake Factory?\n\nNot much.\n\nWe do have a chocolate key lime that's moving pretty well.\n\nGood.\n\nGood.\n\nWhat about your... hallway friend?\n\nDoug?\n\nOh, yeah, I don't know.\n\nI mean, you know, he's nice and funny, but...\n\nCan I get you started with some drinks?\n\nYou were saying? But...\n\nI'd like a drink.\n\nJust say the \"but\" thing about Doug and then I'll get her back.\n\nI don't know, it's just me.\n\nI'm still getting over this breakup with Kurt and this thing with Doug would just be rebound sex.\n\nDon't get me started on rebound sex.\n\nIt's just... it's my pattern.\n\nI break up, then I find some cute guy, and then it's just 36 meaningless hours of... you know.\n\nI'm not sure that I do.\n\nIs that one 36-hour experience, or is that 36 hours spread out over, say... one glorious summer?\n\nNo, it's usually over a weekend, and trust me, you do not feel good after it.\n\nWell, chafing, right?\n\nEmotionally.\n\nOf course, yeah, emotional chafing.\n\nDo you want to see something cool?\n\nI can make this olive go into this glass without touching it.\n\nHow?\n\nPhysics.\n\nCentrifugal force.\n\nActually, it's centripetal force, which is an inward force generated by the glass acting on the olive...\n\nExcuse me.\n\nIf you were riding on the olive, you'd be in a non-inertial reference frame and would...\n\nAre you okay?\n\nYeah, I'm okay.\n\nDid you spill ketchup?\n\nNo.\n\nI'm not okay.\n\nYou sure you don't want to go to the emergency room?\n\nNo, I'm okay.\n\nIt stopped bleeding.\n\nI know, but you did throw up.\n\nIsn't that a sign of a concussion?\n\nYes.\n\nBut I get car sick, too, so...\n\nSorry about your car, by the way.\n\nIt's fine.\n\nYou got most of it out the window.\n\nThe poor guy on the bike.\n\nI had a nice time.\n\nYeah, me, too.\n\nWell, um, good night.\n\nGood night.\n\nWas this supposed to be a date?\n\nThis?\n\nNo.\n\nOf course not.\n\nThis was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn't show up 'cause of work and a colonoscopy.\n\nOkay, I was just checking.\n\nWhen I take a girl on a date-- and I do-- she knows she's been dated.\n\nCapital D.\n\nBoldface.

When was the last time you left the house?\n\nI went to the market with Penny.\n\nThat was three weeks ago.\n\nWell, then buckle up.\n\nIn the next four to eight days she's going to get very crabby.\n\nSweetheart, your little friend is concerned about you.\n\nYes, well, I'm not a child--\n\nI'm a grown man, capable of living my life as I see fit.\n\nAnd I certainly don't need someone telling on me to my mother!\n\nWait, where are you going?\n\nTo my room.\n\nAnd no one's allowed in!\n\nHe gets his temper from his daddy.\n\nHe's got my eyes.\n\nI see.\n\nAll that science stuff, that comes from Jesus.\n\nSheldon, your mom made dinner.\n\nI'm not hungry!\n\nDon't trouble yourself.\n\nHe's stubborn.\n\nHe may stay in there till the Rapture.\n\nWe so sure that's abadthing?\n\nI tell you,\n\nI love the boy to death, but he has been difficult since he fell out of me at the K-Mart.\n\nExcuse me for being so bold, but I now see where Sheldon gets his smoldering good looks.\n\nHoney, that ain't gonna work, but you keep tryin'.\n\nI made chicken.\n\nI hope that isn't one of the animals that you people think is magic.\n\nYou know, we have an Indian gentleman at our church, a Dr. Patel--\n\nIt's a beautiful story.\n\nThe Lord spoke to him and moved him to give us all 20% off on Lasik--\n\nYou know, those that needed it.\n\nThat is a lovely story.\n\nAre we gonna do anything about Sheldon?\n\nOh, we will.\n\nYou have to take your time with Sheldon.\n\nHis father, God rest his soul, used to always say to me, \"Mary, you have to take your time with Sheldon.\"\n\nSounds like a wise man.\n\nOh, not so wise.\n\nHe once tried to fight a bobcat for some licorice.\n\nSo, everybody grab a plate and a pretty place mat that Shelly wove.\n\nHas Shelly ever freaked out like this before?\n\nOh, all the time.\n\nI remember one summer when he was 13, he built a small nuclear reactor in the shed and told everybody he was gonna provide free electricity for the whole town.\n\nWell, the only problem was, he had no what you call \"fissionable\" materials.\n\nAnyway, when he went on the Internets to get some, a man from the government came by and sat him down real gentle, and told him it's against the law to have yellow-cake uranium in a shed.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nWell, poor boy had a fit.\n\nLocked himself in his room and built a sonic death ray.\n\nA death ray?\n\nThat's what he called it.\n\nDidn't even slow down the neighbor kids.\n\nIt pissed our dog off to no end.\n\nYou know, you two make a cute couple.\n\nNo. We're not... we're not-not a couple.\n\nWe're singles. Two singles.\n\nLike those... individuly wrapped slices of cheese that...\n\nWe're friends.\n\nDid I pluck a nerve there?\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nAll right, everybody, it's time to eat.\n\nOh, Lord, we thank You for this meal and all of Your bounty.\n\nAnd we pray that You help Sheldon get back on his rocker.\n\nNow, after a moment of silent meditation,\n\nI'm gonna end with \"In Jesus' name,\" but you two don't feel any obligation to join in.\n\nUnless, of course, the Holy Spirit moves you.\n\nOh, my God, this is the best cobbler I've ever had.\n\nIt was always Sheldon's favorite.\n\nYou know what the secret ingredient is?\n\nLove?\n\nLard.\n\nHey, look who's come...\n\nYou'll spook him.\n\nHe's like a baby deer.\n\nYou got to let him come to you.\n\nThis is ridiculous.\n\nDamn it, Sheldon, snap out of it!\n\nYou're a physicist--\n\nYou belong at the university doing research, not hiding in your room!\n\nYou don't hunt, do you?\n\nGood morning, snickerdoodle.\n\nMorning.\n\nWell, that looks awful fancy.\n\nWhat is that?\n\nIt's my idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon-based life-form.\n\nBut intelligently designed by a creator, right?\n\nWhat do you want, Mom?\n\nYou know how your daddy used to say that you can only fish for so long before you got to throw a stick of dynamite in the water?\n\nWell, I'm done fishing.\n\nYou put those on.\n\nWhat for?\n\nBecause you're gonna go down to your office, you're gonna apologize to your boss and get your job back.\n\nNo.\n\nI'm sorry, did I start that sentence with the words, \"If it please Your Highness\"?\n\nI'm not going to apologize--\n\nI didn't say anything that wasn't true.\n\nNow, you listen here.\n\nI have been telling you since you were four years old, it's okay to be smarter than everybody, but you can't go around pointing it out.\n\nWhy not?\n\nBecause people don't like it!\n\nRemember all the ass-kickings you got from the neighbor kids?\n\nNow, let's get crackin'.\n\nShower, shirt, shoes, and let's shove off.\n\nThere wouldn't have been any ass-kickings if that stupid death ray had worked.\n\nProblem solved.\n\nReally? That's impressive.\n\nLeonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle.\n\nThankfully, He blessed me with two other children who are dumb as soup.\n\nExcuse me, Dr. Gablehauser, are you busy?\n\nWell, actually...\n\nSheldon, he's just doodlin'.\n\nGet in here.\n\nLet's go, baby.\n\nWe're losing daylight.\n\nAs you know, several weeks ago in our first encounter, we may have gotten off on the wrong foot when I called you an idiot.\n\nAnd I just wanted to say that I was wrong... to point it out.\n\nI'm sorry, we haven't been introduced.\n\nSheldon's mom.\n\nNow, that's impossible! You must have had him when you were a teenager.\n\nOh, aren't you sweet.\n\nHis father's dead.\n\nRecently?\n\nLong enough.\n\nPlease.\n\nSheldon, shouldn't you be working?\n\nHey, how did it go?\n\nI got my job back.\n\nReally?\n\nWhat happened?\n\nI'm not quite sure.\n\nIt involves a part of the human experience that has always eluded me.\n\nThat narrows it down.\n\nI'm very proud of you honey.\n\nYou showed a lot of courage today.\n\nThanks, Mom.\n\nIs Dr. Gablehauser going to be my new daddy?\n\nWe'll see.\n\nSleep tight.\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "8d90543c-74dc-4b77-b572-cfce702b7b30": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d90543c-74dc-4b77-b572-cfce702b7b30", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "cf176d89acfe4c7f83302aba34d2b9c35f3acd1688718af6201ec948601b6f86", "text": "\n\nAll right!\n\nI'm moving my infantry division.\n\nAugmented by bataillon of orcs from Lord of the Rings.\n\nWe flank the Tennessee volunteers and the North, once again, wins the battle of Gettysburg.\n\nNot so fast!\n\nRemember, the South still has two infantry divisions, plus Superman and Godzilla.\n\nNo, orcs are magic.

Do I leave?\n\nDo I wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage?\n\nYou're asking the wrong girl.\n\nI'm usually on the other side of the tie.\n\nHi, Leonard?\n\nIt's me, Sheldon...\n\nIn the living room.\n\nI just... I wanted you to know I saw the tie.\n\nMessage received.\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nYou carry on.\n\nGive my best to Leslie.\n\nBig Boy...\n\nSomeone touched my board.\n\nOh, God, my board!\n\nHey, what's the matter?\n\nMy equations, someone's tampered with my equations.\n\nAre you sure?\n\nOf course I am.\n\nLook at the beta function of quantum chromodynamics.\n\nThe sign's been changed.\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nBut doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?\n\nAre you insane?\n\nAre you out of your mind?\n\nAre you-- Look!\n\nThat fixes the problem\n\nI've been having.\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nYou did this?\n\nI noticed it when I got up to get a glass of water.

It's Dr. Stud!\n\nDr. What?\n\nThe blogosphere is a-buzzin' with news of you and Leslie Winkle making <i>eine kleine bang-bang musik</i>.\n\nHow did it get on the Internet?\n\nI put it there.\n\nHow did you know about it?\n\nA little bird told us.\n\nApparently, you are a magnificent beast.\n\nThat part's true.\n\nI think I may have misjudged this restaurant.\n\nNo kidding.\n\nI don't want to go out on a limb, but I think we may be looking at my new Tuesday hamburger.\n\nYour old Tuesday hamburger will be so brokenhearted.\n\nWay ahead of you. I was thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays, and just dropping Souplantation.\n\nReally?\n\nThe name always confused me anyway.\n\nSouplantation.\n\nYou can't grow soup.\n\nSo, how's everything?\n\nTerrific. You'll be happy to know that I plan to come here every Tuesday night for the foreseeable future.\n\nReally?\n\nWho do I speak to about permanently reserving this table?\n\nI don't know...\n\nA psychiatrist?\n\nSo, hey, how are things with you and Leslie?\n\nTo be honest, I don't think it's going to work out.\n\nOh, that's too bad.\n\nHey, don't worry.\n\nI'm sure there's someone out there who's just right for you.\n\nWhat did she mean by that?!\n\nWas that just a generic platitude, or was that a subtle bid for attention?\n\nYou know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy?\n\nThis is a single-decker hamburger, whereas the Big Boy is a double-decker.\n\nThis has a much more satisfying meat-to-bun-to-condiment ratio.\n\nAre you even listening to me?\n\nOf course, I'm listening.\n\nBlah, blah, hopeless Penny delusion...\n\nOkay, then.\n\nYou know, you can grow the ingredients for soup.\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "c0d38dfb-3321-41bc-bba5-cc0d6cb02f50": {"__data__": {"id_": "c0d38dfb-3321-41bc-bba5-cc0d6cb02f50", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "a43e75220ad5d5c43b7cefab22805d8937848dcf6de4447a70e7fbda5d8ac4a7", "text": "\n\nOkay, if no one else was...\n\nWe really sucked at paintball\n\nOh, that was absolutely humiliating\n\nOh, come on.

Sorry we're late.\n\nLate?\n\nIt's 7:05.\n\nAnd you said the party starts at 7:00.\n\nWell, yeah, I mean, when you start a party at 7:00,  no one shows up at, you know, 7:00.\n\nIt's 7:05.\n\nYes. Yes, it is.\n\nOkay. Well, um, come on in.\n\nSo, what, are all the girls in the bathroom?\n\nProbably, but in their own homes.\n\nSo, what time does the costume parade start?\n\nThe parade?\n\nYeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume.\n\nYou know, most frightening, most authentic,  most accurate visualization of a scientific principal.\n\nOh, Sheldon, I'm sorry,  but there aren't going to be any parades or judges or prizes.\n\nThis party is just going to suck.\n\nNo! Come on, it's going to be fun,  and you all look great.\n\nI mean, look at you, Thor,  and, oh, Peter Pan.\n\nThat's so cute.\n\nActually, Penny, he's Robin Hood.\n\nI'm Peter Pan.\n\nAnd I got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it.\n\nNo, you don't.\n\nUh, hey, what's Sheldon supposed to be?\n\nOh, he's the Doppler effect.\n\nYes. It's the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer.\n\nOh, sure, I see it now.\n\nThe Doppler effect.\n\nAll right, I got to shower.\n\nYou guys, um, make yourselves comfortable.\n\nOkay.\n\nSee?\n\nPeople get it.\n\nBy Odin's beard, this is good Chex mix.\n\nNo, thanks. Peanuts.\n\nI can't afford to swell up in these tights.\n\nI'm confused.\n\nIf there's no costume parade, what are we doing here?\n\nWe're socializing, meeting new people.\n\nTelepathically?\n\nOh, hey, when did you get here?\n\nHi.\n\nPenny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I've ever seen.\n\nAnd that includes Halle Berry's.\n\nShe's not Catwoman.\n\nShe's just a generic cat.\n\nAnd that's the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competion.\n\nHey, guys, check out the sexy nurse.\n\nI believe it's time for me to turn my head and cough.\n\nWhat is your move?\n\nI'm going to use the mirror technique.\n\nShe brushes her hair back, I brush my hair back...\n\nShe shrugs, I shrug.\n\nSubconsciously she's thinking, \"We're in sync. We belong together.\"\n\nWhere do you get this stuff?\n\nYou know, psychology journals,\n\nInternet research,  and there's this great show on VH-1 about how to pick up girls.\n\nOh, if only I had his confidence.\n\nI have such difficulty speaking to women, or around women... or at times even effeminate men.\n\nIf that's a working stethoscope,  maybe you'd like to hear my heart skip a beat?\n\nNo, thanks.\n\nNo, seriously, you can.I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia.\n\nI want to get to know Penny's friends, \n\nI just don't know how to talk to these people.\n\nWell, I actually might be able to help.\n\nHow so?\n\nLike Jane Goodall observing the apes, \n\nI initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured.\n\nBut patterns emerge.\n\nThey have their own language, if you will.\n\nGo on.\n\nWell, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting,  \"How wasted am I?\"\n\nWhich is met with an approving chorus of \"Dude.\"\n\nThen what happens?\n\nThat's as far as I've gotten.\n\nThis is ridiculous.\n\nI'm jumping in.\n\nGood luck.\n\nNo, you're coming with me.\n\nOh, I hardly think so.\n\nOh, come on.\n\nAren't you afraid I'll embarrass you?\n\nYes; but I need a wing man.\n\nAll right, but if we're going to use flight metaphors, \n\nI'm much more suited to being the guy from the FAA analyzing wreckage.\n\nHi.\n\nHi. Hello.\n\nSo what are you supposed to be?\n\nMe? I'll give you a hint.\n\nA choo-choo train?\n\nClose!\n\nA brain damaged choo-choo train?\n\nHow wasted am I?\n\nI still don't get it.\n\nI'm the Doppler effect.\n\nOkay, if that's some sort of learning disability, \n\nI think it's very insensitive.\n\nWhy don't you just tell people you're a zebra?\n\nWell, why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves?\n\nBecause I'm Frodo.\n\nYes, well, I'm the Doppler effect.\n\nOh, no.\n\nWhat?\n\nThat's Penny's ex-boyfriend.\n\nWhat do you suppose he's doing here?\n\nBesides disrupting the local gravity field.\n\nIf he were any bigger, he'd have moons orbiting him.\n\nOh, snap.\n\nSo, I guess we'll be leaving now.\n\nWhy should we leave?\n\nFor all we know he crashed the party and Penny doesn't even want him here.\n\nYou have a backup hypothesis?\n\nMaybe they want to be friends.\n\nOr maybe she wants to be friends and he wants something more.\n\nThen he and I are on equal ground.\n\nYes, but you're much closer to it than he is.\n\nLook, if this was 1, 500 years ago,  by virtue of his size and strength, \n\nKurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners.\n\nAnd male partners, animal partners,  large primordial eggplants-- pretty much whatever tickled his fancy.\n\nYes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift.\n\nIn the Information Age, Sheldon,  you and I are the alpha males.\n\nWe shouldn't have to back down.\n\nTrue.\n\nWhy don't you text him that and see if he backs down?\n\nNo.\n\nI'm going to assert my dominance face-to-face.\n\nFace-to-face? Are you going to wait for him to sit down,  or are you going to stand on the coffee table?\n\nHello, Penny.\n\nHello, Kurt.\n\nOh, hey, guys, are you having a good time?\n\nGiven the reaction to my costume,  this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system.\n\nWhat, you're a zebra, right?\n\nYet another child left behind.\n\nAnd what are you supposed to be, an elf?\n\nNo, I'm a hobbit.\n\nWhat's the difference?\n\nA hobbit is a mortal halfling inhabitant of Middle Earth,  whereas an elf is an immortal, tall warrior.\n\nSo why the hell would you want to be a hobbit?\n\nBecause he's neither tall nor immortal and none of us could be The Flash.\n\nWell, whatever.\n\nWhy don't you go hop off on a quest?\n\nI'm talking to Penny here.\n\nI think we're all talking to Penny here.\n\nI'm not. No offense.\n\nOkay, maybe you didn't hear me.\n\nGo away.\n\nAll right, Kurt, be nice.\n\nOh, I am being nice.\n\nRight, little buddy?\n\nKurt.\n\nOkay.\n\nI understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me.\n\nI mean, you can't compete with me on an intellectual level so you're driven to animalistic puffery.\n\nYou calling me a puffy animal?\n\nOf course not. No, he's not.\n\nYou're not, right, Leonard?\n\nNo, I said \"animalistic.\"\n\nOf course we're all animals,  but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree.\n\nIf he understands that, you're in trouble.\n\nSo, what, I'm unevolved?\n\nYou're in trouble.\n\nYou know, you use a lot of big words for such a little dwarf.\n\nOkay, Kurt, please.\n\nPenny, it's okay. I can handle this.\n\nI am not a dwarf, \n\nI'm a hobbit.\n\nA hobbit.\n\nAre misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from short-term to long-term memory?\n\nOkay, now you're starting to make me mad.\n\nA homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what?\n\nWhat?\n\nI think I've made my point.\n\nYeah? How about I make a point out of your pointy little head?\n\nLet me remind you, while my moral support is absolute,  in a physical confrontation,\n\nI will be less than useless.\n\nThere's not going to be a confrontation.\n\nIn fact, I doubt if he can even spell \"confrontation.\"\n\nC- O-N... frontation!\n\nKurt, put him down this instant!\n\nHe started it!\n\nI don't care. I'm finishing it.Put him down!\n\nFine.\n\nYou're one lucky little leprechaun.\n\nHe's a hobbit!\n\nI got your back.\n\nLeonard, are you okay?\n\nYeah, I'm fine.\n\nIt's good, it's a good party, thanks for having us.\n\nIt's just getting a little late, so...\n\nOh, okay.\n\nAll right, well, thank you for coming.\n\nHappy Halloween.\n\nIf it's any consolation, \n\nI thought that homo habilis line really put him in his place.\n\nWhat's that?\n\nTea.\n\nWhen people are upset,  the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages.\n\nThere, there.\n\nYou want to talk about it?\n\nNo.\n\nGood. \"There, there\" was really all I had.\n\nGood night, Sheldon.\n\nGood night, Leonard.\n\nHey, Leonard?\n\nHi, Penny.\n\nHey, I just wanted to make sure you were okay.\n\nI'm fine.\n\nI am so sorry about what happened.\n\nIt's not your fault.\n\nYes, it is.\n\nThat's why I broke up with him.\n\nHe always does stuff like that.\n\nSo why was he at your party?\n\nWell, I ran into him last week and he was just all apologetic about how he's changed.\n\nAnd he was just going on and on and...\n\nI believed him and I'm an idiot because I always believe guys like that.\n\nAnd I can't go back to my party because he's there.\n\nAnd know you don't want to hear this and I'm upset and I'm really drunk and I just want to...\n\nThere, there.\n\nGod, what is wrong with me?\n\nNothing, you're perfect.\n\nI'm not perfect.\n\nYes, you are.\n\nYou really think so, don't you?\n\nPenny?\n\nYeah?\n\nHow much have you had to drink tonight?\n\nJust... a lot.\n\nAre you sure that your being drunk and your being angry with Kurt doesn't have something to do with what's going on here?\n\nIt might.\n\nBoy, you're really smart.\n\nYeah, I'm a frickin' genius.\n\nLeonard, you are so great.\n\nWhy can't all guys be like you?\n\nBecause if all guys were like me,  the human race couldn't survive.\n\nI should probably go.\n\nProbably.\n\nThank you.\n\nThat's right, you saw what you saw.\n\nThat's how we roll in the Shire.\n\nComing.\n\nHey, have you seen Koothrappali?\n\nHe's not here.\n\nMaybe the Avengers summoned him.\n\nHe's not the Marvel Comics Thor, he's the original Norse god.\n\nThank you for the clarification.\n\nI'm supposed to give him a ride home.\n\nWell, I'm sure he'll be fine.\n\nHe has his hammer.\n\nI have to say, you are an amazing man.\n\nYou're gentle, and passionate.\n\nAnd, my God, you are such a good listener.\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "4b380ae6-4c26-4d7d-aa98-14ae8044da61": {"__data__": {"id_": "4b380ae6-4c26-4d7d-aa98-14ae8044da61", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "d650cc9b34f9d0eb47c9ea0cf85f45edf6120484f2a4333372342ad25523f2bc", "text": "\n\nWatch this, it's really cool.\n\nCall Leonard Hoffstadder. \"Call Hellen Boxlightner?</i>\n\nCall Leonard Hoffstadder. \"Call Temple Badsaidor?\"</i>\n\nLet me try!\n\nCall...\n\nThat's very impressive.\n\nAnd a little racist.\n\nIf we're all through playing \"mock the flawed technology,\" can we get on with <i>Halo</i> night?\n\nWe were supposed to start at\n\nSo we'll start now.\n\nFirst we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time, bathroom time or the pizza break.\n\nWe could split it two, two and two.\n\nIf we're having anchovies on the pizza, we can't take it out of bathroom time.\n\nOh, what fresh hell is this?\n\nHey, Penny.

Cover me!\n\nCover this, suckers!\n\nPenny, you are on fire!\n\nYes, and so is Sheldon.\n\nOkay, that's it.\n\nI don't know how, but she is cheating.\n\nNo one can be that attractive and this skilled at a video game.\n\nWait, Sheldon, come back.\n\nYou forgot something.\n\nWhat?\n\nThis plasma grenade.\n\nLook, it's raining you.\n\nYou laugh now-- you just wait until you need tech support.\n\nGosh, he's kind of a sore loser, isn't he?\n\nTo be fair, he's also a rather unpleasant winner.\n\nWell, it's been fun.\n\nWe make such a good team.\n\nMaybe we could enter a couple of <i>Halo</i> tournaments sometime.\n\nOr we could just have a life.\n\nI guess for you that's an option.\n\nGood night.\n\nGood night.\n\nAs usual, nice talking to you, Raj.\n\nWhat do you suppose she meant by that?\n\nShe's an enigma, Raj.\n\nAnd another thing-- there's a certain ethic to the game, Penny, a well- established...\n\nShe's gone.\n\nShe could have said good-bye.\n\nOkay, I have a problem.\n\nIt's called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly you deserve it.\n\nWhat's wrong?\n\nHoward and Christy are... kind of hooking up in my bedroom.\n\nAre you sure?\n\nI grew up on a farm, okay?\n\nFrom what I heard, they're either having sex or Howard's caught in a milking machine.\n\nDo you mind if I stay here tonight?\n\nNo, take the couch, or my bed.\n\nI just got new pillows.\n\nHypo-allergenic.\n\nThe couch is good.\n\nHold that thought.\n\nLeonard, a moment.\n\nLet me guess.\n\nYou have a problem with this.\n\nWhere do I begin?\n\nIt's up to you. Crazy person's choice.\n\nFirst, we don't have houseguests.\n\nFrankly, if I could afford the rent, I'd ask you to leave.\n\nYour friendship means a lot to me as well. What else?\n\nWell... our earthquake supplies.\n\nWe have a two-man, two-day kit.\n\nSo?\n\nSo if there's an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here, we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon.\n\nI'm sorry, are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?\n\nNo one ever thinks it'll happen until it does.\n\nIf you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep, you can stay.\n\nWhat?\n\nHe's engaging in reductio ad absurdum.\n\nIt's the logical fallacy of extending someone's argument to ridiculous proportions and then criticizing the result.\n\nAnd I do not appreciate it.\n\nI'll get you a blanket and a pillow.\n\nOkay, since I'm obviously being ignored here, let's go over the morning schedule.\n\nI use the bathroom from 7:00 to 7:20.\n\nPlan your ablutions and bodily functions accordingly.\n\nHow am I supposed to plan my bodily functions?\n\nI suggest no liquids after 11:00 p.m.\n\nHere you go.\n\nThanks, Leonard.\n\nWrong.\n\nI'm listening.\n\nYour head goes on the other end.\n\nWhy?\n\nIt's culturally universal. A bed, even a temporary bed, is always oriented with the headboard away from the door.\n\nIt serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders.\n\nI'll risk it.\n\nAnything else should I know?\n\nYes, if you use my toothbrush,\n\nI'll jump out that window.\n\nPlease don't come to my funeral.\n\nHave a good night.\n\nSorry about that.\n\nThat's okay.\n\nFYI-- his toothbrush is the red one in the Plexiglas case under the UV light.\n\nGot it.\n\nSleep tight.\n\nThanks\n\nFunny expression, \"sleep tight.\"\n\nIt refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes, which would occasionally...\n\nSleep tight.\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\nEvery Saturday since we've lived in this apartment\n\nI have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal, added a quarter cup of two percent milk, sat on this end of this couch, turned on BBC America, and watched <i>Doctor Who</i>.\n\nPenny's still sleeping.\n\nEvery Saturday since we've lived in this apartment\n\nI have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl\n\nI know.\n\nYou have a TV in your room.\n\nWhy don't you just have breakfast in bed?\n\nBecause I am neither an invalid, nor a woman celebrating Mother's Day.\n\nWhat time is it?\n\nAlmost 6:30.\n\nI slept all day?\n\nNo, it's 6:30 in the morning.\n\nWhat the hell is your problem?\n\nOkay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity.\n\nI now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste.\n\nHola, nerd-migos.\n\nWhy do you people hate sleep?\n\nAre you wearing my robe?\n\nYeah.\n\nSorry, I'll have it cleaned.\n\nThat's okay, keep it.\n\nWhere's Christy?\n\nIn the shower.\n\nBy the way, where did you get that loofah mitt?\n\nYours reaches places that mine just won't.\n\nYou used my loofah?\n\nMore precisely, weused your loofah.\n\nI exfoliated her brains out.\n\nYou can keep that, too.\n\nThen we'll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection.\n\nIn here, milady!\n\nHere's my little engine that could.\n\nThere's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.\n\nHi. Christy.\n\nI'm Sheldon.\n\nRight.\n\nYou're Howard's entourage.\n\nSo, Christy, what are your plans?\n\nHoward said he'd take me shopping in Beverly Hills.\n\nYeah, no, I meant plans to find someplace to live.\n\nOther than with me.\n\nNot that I don't love having you, but it's...\n\nIt's a little crowded.\n\nPenny, you're always welcome to stay with us.\n\nOh, terrific.\n\nNow we're running a cute little B & B.\n\nLet me offer a little outside-the-box thinking here.\n\nWhy doesn't Christy stay with me?\n\nYou live with your mother.\n\nI do not.\n\nMy mother lives with me.\n\nThen it's all settled.\n\nChristy will stay with Howard,\n\nPenny can go back to her apartment, and I'll watch the last 24 minutes of <i>Doctor Who</i>.\n\nAlthough at this point, it's more like <i>Doctor Why Bother</i>?\n\nSheldon, you just can't dictate...\n\nNo more talking! Everybody go!\n\nSo what do you say?\n\nWant to repair to Casa Wolowitz?\n\nWhat is that, like a Mexican deli?\n\nI'm sorry,\n\nI should have mentioned this earlier.\n\nMy last name is Wolowitz.\n\nThat's so cool.\n\nMy first Jew.\n\nI imagine there aren't very many\n\nKosher Cornhuskers.\n\nBut you're still taking me shopping?\n\nAnything you want.\n\nOkay, I'll go pack my stuff.\n\nWhen they perfect human cloning,\n\nI'm going to order 12 of those.\n\nCan't you see she's using you?\n\nWho cares? Last night, she pulled off her blouse and I wept.\n\nI know her. Okay?\n\nShe'll have sex with anyone, as long as they keep buying her things.\n\nReally?\n\nYeah.\n\nIf you'll excuse me,\n\nI have some Bar Mitzvah bonds to cash.\n\nI'm sorry, we cannot do this without Wolowitz.\n\nWe can't order Chinese food without Wolowitz?\n\nLet me walk you through it.\n\nOur standard order is: the steamed dumpling appetizer,\n\nGeneral Tso's chicken, beef with broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo mein.\n\nDo you see the problem?\n\nI see a problem.\n\nOur entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided amongst four people.\n\nSo, we'll just order three entrees.\n\nFine.\n\nWhat do you want to eliminate?\n\nAnd who gets the extra dumpling?\n\nWe could cut it into thirds.\n\nThen it's no longer a dumpling.\n\nOnce you cut it open it is, at best, a very small open-faced sandwich.\n\nHi, fellas.\n\nWhere's your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks Mandarin?\n\nHe's putting his needs ahead of the collective good.\n\nWhere he comes from, that's punishable by death.\n\nI come from Sacramento.\n\nCan we get an order of dumplings but with three instead of four?\n\nNo substitutions.\n\nThis isn't a substitution.\n\nIt's a reduction.\n\nOkay.\n\nNo reductions.\n\nFine. Bring us three orders of dumplings.\n\nThat's 12. We'll each have four.\n\nThat works.\n\nIf we fill up on dumplings, we need to eliminate another entree.\n\nNo eliminations.\n\nIf we have extra, we'll just take the leftovers home.\n\nAnd divide it how? I'm telling you, we cannot do this without Wolowitz.\n\nWolowitz is with his new girlfriend.\n\nIf you had let me invite Penny, then you would have had your fourth.\n\nHave you seen Penny eat Chinese food?\n\nShe uses a fork and she double-dips her egg rolls.\n\nWe don't order egg rolls.\n\nExactly, but we'd have to if she was here!\n\nCan we please make a decision?\n\nNot only are there children starving in India, there's an Indian starving right here.\n\nThere's an idea. Why don't we just go out for Indian food?\n\nYou're nice boys.\n\nTell you what I'm going to do.\n\nI'm going to bring you the four dumplings.\n\nWhen I'm walking over to the table, maybe I get bumped, one of the dumplings fall to the floor.\n\nNo one has to know.\n\nI'll know.\n\nHow about soup?\n\nYeah, we can always divide soup.\n\nWhat about the wontons?\n\nHey, guys, what's up?\n\nIt's <i>Halo</i> night.\n\nSo?\n\nWith Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend Christy...\n\nShe's not my friend. Friends do not get their friends' Care Bears all sweaty.\n\nRight. Anyway, uh, with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere, we had something we wanted to ask you.\n\nYes.\n\nWe would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our <i>Halo</i> team.\n\nI don't think I need to tell you what an honor this is.\n\nThat's so sweet, but I'm going out dancing with a girlfriend.\n\nYou can't go out; it's <i>Halo</i> night.\n\nWell, for Penny, it's dancing night.\n\nYou go dancing every Wednesday?\n\nNo.\n\nThen that's not \"dancing night.\"\n\nWhy don't I play with you guys tomorrow?\n\nTonight is <i>Halo</i> night.\n\nIt's like talking to a wall.\n\nAll right, now, Sheldon, you and I are about to have a problem.\n\nSheldon, remember, we role-played this.\n\nYes, but you didn't portray her as completely irrational.\n\nAll right, fellas,\n\nI gotta go.\n\nBut good luck.\n\nMaybe we should've asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend.\n\nAssuming we could dance-- which we can't-- there are three of us and two of them.\n\nSo?\n\nIt's the Chinese restaurant all over again.\n\nI assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child's play compared with three men each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman.\n\nFor God's sakes, Sheldon, you're driving me crazy!\n\nYour anger is not with me, sir, but with basic mathematics.\n\nI'm pretty sure my anger is with you.\n\nWhat's happening to us?\n\nWe're falling apart.\n\nWho are you calling?\n\nThe only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe. right now because we're having sex!</i> on your message, are you?</i>\n\nI'll re-record it.</i>\n\nSheldon, think this through.\n\nYou're going to ask Howard to choose between sex and <i>Halo</i>.\n\nNo, I'm going to ask him to choose between sex and <i>Halo Three</i>.\n\nAs far as I know, sex has not been upgraded to include Hi-Def graphics and enhanced weapon systems.\n\nYou're right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms and human contact.\n\nMy point.\n\nYou can take the damn plastic off the couch once in a while!\n\nWhy, so you and Howard can hump on it?!\n\nLadies, ladies,\n\nI'm sure there's a middle ground.\n\nShut up, Howard!\n\nYou guys talk. I'm gonna take my scooter out for a little spin.\n\nYou happy? You drove your own son out of the house.\n\nWhy don't you stop...\n\nWhat are you doing here?\n\nIt's <i>Halo</i> night.\n\nHe's not a man, he's a putz!\n\nAnd don't you take that tone with me, you gold digger!\n\nWhat'd you call me?\n\nYou heard me!\n\nAnd I'll tell you something else, you're barking up the wrong tree. 'Cause as long as you're around,\n\nHoward is out of the will!\n\nYou know what?\n\nI got better offers. I'm outta here.\n\nThat's right.\n\nGo back to Babylon, you whore!\n\nSo, <i>Halo</i> night, huh?\n\nI thought she was the whore of Omaha.\n\nSheldon, you got him in your sights!\n\nFire! He's charging his plasma rifle!\n\nI can't shoot now. I'm cloaking!\n\nRaj! Kill Sheldon!\n\nI can't see him!\n\nThat's why they call it cloaking, dead man!\n\nStart throwing grenades!\n\nI'm all out!\n\nHey, guys.\n\nMy friends and I got tired of dancing, so we came over to have sex with you.\n\nRaj, hop in the tank!\n\nWe said no tanks!\n\nThere are no rules in hell!\n\nSon of a bitch. Med pack!\n\nI need a med pack!\n\nTold ya.\n\nThere's a sniper.\n\nUse your rocket launcher!\n\nAll I've got is a Needler and I'm all out of ammo!\n\nAnd now you're out of life.\n\nWhy'd you hit pause?\n\nI thought I heard... something.\n\nWhat?\n\nNo, never mind.\n\nSorry.

Hello?\n\nMy parents are trying to marry me to a total stranger. What am I going to do?\n\nI suggest you go through with it.\n\nWhat?!\n\nRomantic love as the basis for marriage has only existed since the 19th century.\n\nUp until then, arranged marriages were the norm, and it served society quite well.\n\nIt's the entire premise of <i>Fiddler on the Roof</i>.\n\nI'm not a big fan of musicals, but I love that show.\n\nMe too.\n\nOf course, it speaks to me culturally.\n\nUnderstandable, but there's a universality to that story which transcends ethnicity.\n\nLet's not forget it's got some really catchy tunes.\n\nI know what I'm going to do.\n\nWhat?\n\nFind new friends.\n\nSo who wants to rent <i>Fiddler</i>?\n\nNo need, we have the special edition.\n\nMaybe we are like Haroon and Tanvir.\n\nSeason 1 Episode 8:\n\nThe Grasshopper Experiment\n\nThis is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.\n\nYeah, I need to cancel my membership to the planetarium.\n\nWell, I'm sorry, too, but there's just no room for you in my wallet.\n\nI understand, but it was between you and the Museum of Natural History, and frankly, you don't have dinosaurs.\n\nI'll miss you, too.

Good. Coming up.\n\nSheldon, what are you going to have?\n\nI'll have a Diet Coke.\n\nCan you please order a cocktail?\n\nI need to practice mixing drinks.\n\nFine.\n\nI'll have a Virgin Cuba Libre.\n\nThat's, rum and Coke without the rum.\n\nYes.\n\nSo... Coke.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd would you make it diet?\n\nThere's a can in the fridge.\n\nA Cuba Libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge.\n\nThen swim to Cuba.\n\nBartenders are supposed to have people skills.\n\nRaj, here you go.\n\nAll right.\n\nWho's next?\n\nI'd like to try a Slippery Nipple.\n\nOkay, you're cut off.\n\nAnybody need a refill?\n\nWhere did my life go, Penny?\n\nOne day I'm a carefree bachelor, and the next I'm married and driving a minivan to peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi.\n\nAre you talking to me?\n\nIs the another Penny here?\n\nI had such plans.\n\nI had dreams.\n\nI was going to be the Indira Gandhi of particle astrophysics.\n\nBut with a penis, of course.\n\nAmazing.\n\nEver since I was a little boy, my father wanted me to be a gynecologist like him.\n\nHow can I be a gynecologist?\n\nI can barely look a woman in the eye!\n\nYou know what?\n\nI'm not going to let my parents control my future any longer.\n\nIt's time for a showdown.\n\nSomebody give me a computer with a webcam!\n\nSweetie, I think that's the Grasshopper talking.\n\nAnd it's about to tell my parents that I'm not riding an elephant down the aisle with Lalita Gupta.\n\nOkay, calm down.\n\nNo one can make you get married.\n\nWhy don't you just meet this girl and see what happens?\n\nHaven't you been listening to me?\n\nI cannot talk to women.\n\nNo, no, let's see how long it takes him.\n\nRaj, honey, you say you can't talk to women, but you've been talking to me.\n\nAnd now we'll never know.\n\nYou're right.\n\nI am talking to you.\n\nHello, Penny, how are you?\n\nI'm fine.\n\nOkay, now I just need to make sure I have a Lalita before I meet the Grasshopper.\n\nIt's a sweet, green miracle.\n\nIf you're going to drink on this date, just promise me you won't overdo it.\n\nOverdo what?\n\nHappiness?\n\nFreedom?\n\nThis warm glow inside of me that promises everything's going to be all hunky-dunky?\n\nYeah, that.\n\nWhy don't you bring her to my restaurant while I'm tending the bar so I can keep an eye on you.\n\nWhat's the plan here?\n\nLet's say he meets her, he likes her, they get married.\n\nWhat's he going to do, stay drunk for the rest of his life?\n\nWorked for my parents.\n\nI can't believe I'm sitting here next to little Lalita Gupta.\n\nWell, you are.\n\nLittle Lalita.\n\nThat's kind of fun to say.\n\nLittle Lalita, little\n\nLalita, little Lalita.\n\nYou should try it.\n\nOh, it's okay.\n\nYou have lost so much weight.\n\nThat must have been difficult for you because you were so, so fat.\n\nDo you remember?\n\nYes, I do.\n\nOf course you do.\n\nWho could forget being that fat?\n\nI've been trying.\n\nSo you're a dental student.\n\nAre you aware that dentists have an extremely high suicide rate?\n\nNot as high as, say, air traffic controllers, but there are far more dentists than air traffic controllers, so in pure numbers, you're still winning.\n\nYay, me.\n\nDo you have a drink that will make him less obnoxious?\n\nDrinks do not work that way.\n\nI'd say he's doing fine.\n\nLook at her.\n\nThe last girl my mom set me up with had a mustache and a vestigial tail.\n\nSorry I'm late.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nNothing.\n\nI just really didn't want to come.\n\nVirgin diet Cuba Libre, please.\n\nIn a tall glass with a lime wedge.\n\nOh, I'll wedge it right in there.\n\nSo how's Koothrappali...\n\nOh, my Lord.\n\nWhat?\n\nThat's Princess Panchali.\n\nI'm pretty sure her name's Lalita.\n\nNo, no, Princess Panchali, fromThe Monkey and the Princess.\n\nOh, yeah. I tried to watch that online, but they wanted my credit card.\n\nIt's a children's story.\n\nOh, no, it isn't.\n\nWhen I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time, my mother would read it to me.\n\nIt's about an Indian princess who befriends a monkey who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different.\n\nFor some reason,\n\nI related to it quite strongly.\n\nI know the reason.\n\nWe all know the reason.\n\nSheldon, what are you getting at?\n\nThat woman looks exactly like the pictures of Princess Panchali in the book.\n\nHow often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life?\n\nEvery year at Comic-Con.\n\nEvery day at Disneyland.\n\nYou can hire Snow White to come to your house.\n\nOf course, they prefer it if you have a kid.\n\nHey, guys.\n\nThis is Lalita Gupta.\n\nLalita, this is Leonard and Sheldon and Howard and Penny.\n\nIsn't it great?\n\nShe isn't fat anymore. \"Forgive me, Your Highness, for I am but a monkey, \"and it is in my nature to climb. \"I did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair.\"\n\nI'm sorry?\n\nYou are the living embodiment of the beautiful Princess Panchali.\n\nOh, no kidding.\n\nWho is that?\n\nA beloved character from an Indian folktale.\n\nUs Indian or \"Come to our casino\" Indian?\n\nYou Indian.\n\nThe resemblance is remarkable.\n\nI can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair.\n\nWell, thanks.\n\nI imagine you smell very nice, too.\n\nI shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.\n\nReally? So do I.\n\nBut you're a dentist.\n\nHe's nuts.\n\nDon't be insulting, Rajesh.\n\nSo, Sheldon, tell me more about this princess you say I look like.\n\nIt was said that the gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips.\n\nOh, my.\n\nBack off, Sheldon.\n\nWhat?\n\nIf you do not stop hitting on my lady, you'll feel the full extent of my wrath.\n\nI'm not hitting on her.\n\nAnd I am not your lady.\n\nAnd you have no wrath.\n\nYou are my lady.\n\nOur parents said so.\n\nWe are, for all intents and purposes, 100% hooked up.\n\nLet's get something straight here.\n\nThe only reason I came tonight was to get my parents off my case.\n\nI certainly don't need to be getting this Old World crap from you.\n\nThat's exactly the kind of spirit with which Princess Panchali led the monkeys to freedom.\n\nScrew Princess Panchali.\n\nYou can't talk to me like that.\n\nBut you're not Princess Panchali.\n\nLuckily for you-- she could have you beheaded.\n\nSheldon, are you hungry?\n\nI could eat.\n\nLet's go.\n\nWhat just happened?\n\nBeats the hell out of me.\n\nI'll tell you what happened. I just learned how to pick up Indian chicks. to Lalita's parents?</i>\n\nI won't be able to look at him.</i>\n\nMaybe you should keep your eye on the ball, Papa.\n\nDr. and Mrs. Koothrappali, in all fairness, it wasn't entirely Raj's fault.\n\nI'm Leonard.\n\nSorry.\n\nYou all look alike to us.\n\nBut he's right, Papa.\n\nListen to him.\n\nYou! You are the one who ruined everything.\n\nWe can't see.</i>\n\nTurn us!</i>\n\nGo ahead, tell my parents why they won't have any grandchildren.\n\nHow would I know?\n\nDo you have a low sperm count?\n\nThis has nothing to do with my sperm count. that we sent you, aren't you?</i>\n\nYes, Mumi.\n\nCan we please stop talking about my testicles?\n\nSheldon, tell them what you did.\n\nWhat did I do?\n\nYou left with his date.\n\nFriends don't do that to each other.\n\nAll right, noted.\n\nSorry.\n\nSorry?\n\nThat's all you can say is sorry?\n\nTake it.\n\nIt's more than I've ever gotten.\n\nMay I point out, she wouldn't have asked me to go with her if you hadn't been drunk and boring.\n\nAnd boring-- her words. and he becomes an alcoholic.</i>\n\nI'm not an alcoholic.\n\nIt was just this one time, I swear.\n\nCarry us outside.</i>\n\nBut, Papa, please...\n\nI have to go.\n\nNow, listen to me...\n\nAt least wait till I get into the hall.\n\nOkay, well, good night.\n\nHold on.\n\nWhat happened with you and Lalita?\n\nWe ate, she lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks-- nothing I didn't already know-- and I came home.\n\nSo you're not going to see her again?\n\nWhy would I see her again?\n\nI already have a dentist.\n\nI wonder who's going to tell his parents they're not having grandchildren?\n\nI don't believe it.\n\nWhat's gotten into him?\n\nOh, maybe a couple virgin Cuba Libres that turned out to be kind of slutty.\n\nYou didn't.\n\nYou do your experiments.\n\nI do mine.\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "e2498352-4d60-4af2-9342-486af22a101e": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2498352-4d60-4af2-9342-486af22a101e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "947a3f801a9da3a7c19044350d3d9f822df22b93e71131517160bf3696e173a5", "text": "\n\nOk...\n\nThe X10's are online\n\nGentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local ISP racing down fibre optic cable at the speed of light to San Fransisco, bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to\n\nLisbon, Portugal, where the data packets will be headed off to submerge transatlantic cables, terminating in Halifax,\n\nNova Scotia and transfered across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP\n\nAnd the extend receiver attached to this...\n\nLamp.\n\nLook at me, look at me.\n\nI've got goosebumps.\n\nAre we ready for the stereo?\n\nGo for stereo.\n\nHey guys.\n\nHello.\n\nIt's a little loud.\n\nNo problem...

What a nerd.\n\nAre there any other honours I've got that I don't know about?\n\nDid the UPS dropped off a\n\nNobel prize with my name on it?\n\nLeonard, please don't take this the wrong way, but the day you win a\n\nNobel prize, is the day I begin my research on the drag coefficient of tassles on flying carpets.\n\nThe only thing missing from that insult was: \"your mama\".\n\nI got one... Hey Leonard,\n\nYour mama's research methodology is so flawed...\n\nShut up, Howard.\n\nSheldon, we have to do this.\n\nNo, we don't.\n\nWe have to take a nourishment, to expel waste, and inhale enough oxygen to keep our cells from dying.\n\nEverything else is optional.\n\nOk, let me put it this way:\n\nI'm doing it.\n\nYou can't. I'm the lead author.\n\nCome on, the only reason you're the lead author is because we went alphabetically.\n\nI let you think we went alphabetically to spare you the humiliation with dealing with the fact that it was my idea.\n\nNow to put too fine a point to it, but I was throwing you a bone.\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nExcuse me, I designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis.\n\nThat doesn't mean proving.\n\nSo the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word?\n\nThey're not supposed to, but they should.\n\nAlright, I don't care what you say.\n\nI'm going to the conference and I'm presenting our findings\n\nAnd I forbid it.\n\nYou forbid it?\n\nIf I'm not taking credit for our work then nobody is.\n\nSo, you admit that it's our work.\n\nNo.\n\nOnce again,\n\nI'm throwing you a bone.\n\nAnd once again, you are welcome.\n\nSo, how's it going with Sheldon? Are you guys still not talking to each other?\n\nNot only is he still not talking to me, but there's this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode.\n\nYou know, like in the classic sci-fi movie \"Scanners\"?\n\nLike... . Bzzz.\n\nNevermind.\n\nHow about this one?\n\nIt says, I know my physics, but I'm still a fun guy.\n\nOh, I didn't know they still made corduroy suits.\n\nThey don't, that's why I saved this one.\n\nOk, well, let's just see what else you have.\n\nOk, here. Take this.\n\nAnd this, and this, and this, and these...\n\nIs this all stuff you want me to try on?\n\nNo, this is stuff I want you to throw out.\n\nSeriously, don't even give it to charity, you won't be helping anyone.\n\nWhat's this?\n\nThat's the bottled city of Kandor.\n\nYou see, Kandor was the capital city of the planet Krypton.\n\nIt was miniaturised by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by Superman.\n\nOh, nice.\n\nIt's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.\n\nHere, why don't you put these while\n\nI find a shirt and a sport cut match.\n\nRight, be right back.\n\nWhere are you going?\n\nJust put them on.\n\nHere?\n\nOh, are you shy?\n\nNo, I'm not shy.\n\nDon't worry I won't look.\n\nI know you won't look.\n\nWhy would you look?\n\nThere's nothing to see...\n\nWell, not 'nothing'...\n\nSweetie, put the pants on.\n\nSo, you know, isn't there maybe some way you and Sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing?\n\nNo, No.\n\nScientists do not compromise.\n\nOur minds are trained to synthetize facts and come to inarguable conclusions.\n\nNot to mention,\n\nSheldon is back-crap crazy.\n\nWhat is this?\n\nOh, careful.\n\nThat's my original series\n\nBattlestar Galactica flight suit.\n\nOh, why didn't you wear it on Halloween?\n\nBecause it's not a costume, it's a flight suit.\n\nOk, alright, moving on.\n\nOh, wow. A paisley shirt.\n\nIt goes with my corduroy suit.\n\nIf you mean it should end up in the same place, then I agree.\n\nIs this your only tie?\n\nTechnically, yes.\n\nBut, if you'll notice...\n\nIt's reversible!\n\nSo it works as two.\n\nSweetie, I don't even think it works as one.\n\nIs this all your clothes?\n\nEh, yeah.\n\nEverything since the eighth grade.\n\nThe eighth grade?\n\nMy last growth sprout\n\nOk, well, let's go back to the curdoroy suit.\n\nGreat.\n\nYeah.\n\nI said no. Put it down.\n\nHey Sheldon.\n\nHello Penny.\n\nGet anything good?\n\nJust the latest copy of Applied\n\nParticle Physics quarterly.\n\nOh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't.\n\nIt was a joke.\n\nYep.\n\nTip you waitresses.\n\nI'm here all week.\n\nPenny, just to save you from further awkwardness, know that I'm perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence.\n\nOh, yeah ok, me too.\n\nZip it, lock it.\n\nPut it in your pocket.\n\nSo, you and Leonard...\n\nOh dear God...\n\nLittle misunderstanding, huh?\n\nA little misunderstanding... ?\n\nGalileo and the Pope had a little misunderstanding.\n\nAnyway, I was talking to Leonard this morning and I think he feels really bad about it.\n\nHow do you feel?\n\nI don't understand the question.\n\nI'm just asking if it's difficult to be fighting with your best friend.\n\nI haven't thought about it like that.\n\nI wonder if I've been experiencing physiological manifestations of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil\n\nWait, what?\n\nI couldn't poop this morning.\n\nYou should just talk to him,\n\nI'm sure you guys can work this out.\n\nCertainly preferable to my plan.\n\nWhich was?\n\nA powerful laxative.\n\nYou absolutely should talk to him.\n\nLook, I know Leonard values you as a friend and he told me himself without your little idea there's no way he could come up with this whole experiment thing.\n\nExcuse me. \"Little idea\"?\n\nYeah, I mean he tried to explain it to me,\n\nI didn't really understand it but...\n\nOf course you didn't.\n\nHe said: \"Little idea\"?\n\nOh, well, no... Not...\n\nNot in those words.\n\nIn what words then, exactly?\n\nOh, you know... Gee. The exact words are... It's more the spirit in which he said...\n\nWhat did he say?\n\nYou had a lucky hunch\n\nHey, Sheldon, I've been thinking, instead of arguing about this...\n\nDon't you ever speak to me again.\n\nWhat... ?\n\nOk, I'm leaving for the conference.\n\nHave fun presenting my \"lucky hunch\"\n\nShel, I didn't mean it like that.\n\nThen why did you say it?\n\nI don't know, I wasn't...\n\nWere you trying to impress Penny?\n\nNo, no, not at all. A little bit.\n\nHow did that work out for you?\n\nLeonard, ready to go?\n\nLibido: 1 Truth: 0.\n\nOk, I'm gonna ask you one more time.\n\nWe did the work together, let's present the paper together.\n\nAnd I'm telling you for the last time, it's pandering, it's undignifying, and bite me.\n\nLet's go.\n\nBye Sheldon.\n\nGoodbye Penny.\n\nOne of these days... bshh!\n\nThere you go.\n\nYou're right this side does look better.\n\nNo, no, I didn't say better,\n\nI said \"less stained\".\n\nI just checked the house.\n\nThere's probably 20-25 people in there.\n\nYou're kidding!\n\nIs that all? \"All? \" In particle physics 25 is Woodstock!\n\nThen good!\n\nI wasn't expecting such a crowd,\n\nI'm all nervous.\n\nIt's ok, just open with a joke, you'll be fine.\n\nA joke... Ok.\n\nHow about this? Um, ok...\n\nThere's this farmer and he has these chickens but they won't lay any eggs, so...\n\nHe calls a physicist to help.\n\nThe physicist then does some calculations, and he says: \"I have a solution, but it only works for spherical chickens in a vacuum\".\n\nRight?\n\nOh, sorry,\n\nI just had heard it before.\n\nLet's roll. Hey, nice suit.\n\nIt's a classic, right?\n\nI really should have brought my own car.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the data show that at temperatures approaching absolute zero, the moment of inertia changes, and a solid becomes a supersolid, which clearly appears to be a previously unknown state of matter.\n\nThank you!\n\nAre there any questions?\n\nYeah.\n\nWhat the hell was that?\n\nAny other questions?\n\nDoctor Sheldon Cooper here, I am the lead author of this particular paper.\n\nThank you.\n\nAnd you sir, you have completely skipped over the part where I was walking through the park and I saw these children on a merry-go-round which started me thinking about the moment of inertia in gases like helium at temperatures approaching absolute zero.\n\nI didn't skip it.\n\nIt's just an anecdote, it's not science.\n\nOh, I see. It was the apple falling on Newton's head, was that just an anecdote?\n\nYou are not Isaac Newton.\n\nNo, no, that's true. Gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple.\n\nYou cannot possibly be that arrogant.\n\nYou continue to underestimate me, my good man.\n\nLook, if you weren't happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me!\n\nAs I have explained repeatedly, unlike you,\n\nI don't need validation from lesser minds.\n\nNo offense.\n\nReally, so why did you come?\n\nBecause I knew you'd screw this up.\n\nI didn't screw it up!\n\nOh, please.\n\nI admit that spherical chicken joke, that was hilarious.\n\nThank you.\n\nBut it was straight downhill from there.\n\nI've had enough of your condescendship.\n\nMaybe I didn't go to college when I was 11 like you.\n\nMaybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16 but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room!\n\nNo offense.\n\nAnd I am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation!\n\nSo you admit you're an egotist?\n\nYes!\n\nMy name is doctor Leonard Hofstadter and I can never please my parents so\n\nI need all my self esteem from strangers like you!\n\nBut he's worse!\n\nOk, that's it!\n\nStop it!\n\nYou cannot blow up my head with your mind!\n\nThen I'll settle for your aneurism!\n\nStop it!\n\nYou hit me!\n\nYou saw that he hit me!\n\nYou tried to blow up my head!\n\nSo it was working!\n\nIt wa... It was not!\n\nYou're a nutcase!\n\nWe'll see about that!\n\nHeads up, you people in the front row!\n\nThis is a splash zone!\n\nStop it!\n\nJust quit it!\n\nIs this usually how these physics things go?\n\nMore often than you think.\n\nYou could have offered me a ride home.\n\nYou're lucky I didn't run you over.\n\nI really don't understand what you're so unhappy about.\n\nYou begged me to come, I came.\n\nThere's just no pleasing you.\n\nYou're right, I'm the problem,\n\nI'm the one that needs help.\n\nWell, that's not much of an apology but I'll take it.\n\nExcuse me, is there anything you would apologise for?\n\nYes.\n\nI'm sorry I tried to blow up your head.\n\nIt was uncalled for.\n\nYou won't believe this.\n\nSomebody got the whole thing with their cell phone and put it on YouTube!\n\nWhat?\n\nWho would do that?\n\nThat would be me.\n\nHey, check it out, it's a featured video!\n\nHe hit me!\n\nYou saw that he hit me!\n\nThen it was working!\n\nIt was not working!

All right.\n\nLeonard?\n\nYes?\n\nWhen we played chess earlier, you were terrific, and I can't wait to play you again.\n\nGood night.\n\nLeonard?\n\nThis would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath.\n\nWhat?\n\nI was analyzing our lie, and I believe we're in danger of Penny seeing through the ruse.\n\nHow?\n\nSimple: If she were to log onto \"www.socalphysixs-group.org/activities/other\" click on \"Upcoming Events,\" scroll down to \"Seminars,\" download the PDF schedule, and look for the seminar on molecular positronium, well then. Bippity, boppity, boo-- our pants are metaphorically on fire.\n\nWell, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today.\n\nPenny?\n\nGood morning!\n\nDo you have any idea what time it is?\n\nOf course I do.\n\nMy watch is linked to the atomic clock in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nIt's accurate to one tenth of a second.\n\nBut as I'm saying this, it occurs to me that, once again, your question may have been rhetorical.\n\nWhat do you want?\n\nRemember how Leonard told you we couldn't come to your performance because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium?\n\nI remember \"symposium.\"\n\nYes. Well... \n\nHe lied.\n\nWait.\n\nWhat?\n\nHe lied, and I'm feeling very uncomfortable about it.\n\nWell, imagine how I'm feeling.\n\nHungry?\n\nTired?\n\nI'm sorry, this really isn't my strong suit.\n\nYou told her I lied?\n\nWhy would you tell her I lied?\n\nTo help you.\n\nI'm sorry,\n\nI'm not seeing the help.\n\nShe was going to see through your lie eventually, so I told her that you were lying to protect me.\n\nI'm getting a bad feeling.\n\nHunger?\n\nIndigestion?\n\nI'm sorry, I'm really not very good at this.\n\nAnyway, Penny now believes that, on Friday night, we're going to participate in my cousin\n\nLeopold's drug intervention.\n\nYour cousin Leopold.\n\nWho most people call Leo, but he also answers to Lee.\n\nRemember that. It's important.\n\nWhat's important?\n\nDetails, Leonard-- the success or failure of our deceitful enterprise turns on details.\n\nDo you have a cousin Leopold?\n\nNo. I made him up.\n\nI think you'd call him Lee.\n\nI don't get it.\n\nI already told her a lie.\n\nWhy replace it with a different lie?\n\nWell, first of all, your lie was laughably transparent, where mine is exquisitely convoluted.\n\nWhile you were sleeping,\n\nI was weaving an un-unravelable web.\n\nUn-unravelable?\n\nYes.\n\nIf she Googles \"Leopold Houston,\" she'll find a Facebook page, an online blog depicting his descent into drug use and a desperate yet hopeful listing on eHarmony.com.\n\nOkay, why would I go to a drug intervention for your cousin?\n\nBecause it's in Long Beach, and I don't drive.\n\nWe're going to Long Beach?\n\nOf course not. \n\nThere's no cousin Leo.\n\nThere's no intervention.\n\nFocus, Leonard.\n\nAw, come on.\n\nWe just leave the house on Friday night and we return in the wee hours,emotionally wrung out, from the work of convincing Leo to go back into rehab.\n\nHe goes back into rehab?\n\nYes, but, he can relapse if Penny ever invites us to hear her sing again.\n\nYou still told her I lied.\n\nFor a noble purpose-- to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug-addled first cousin-- which I'm assuming is embarrassing, yes?\n\nHow am I supposed to remember all of this?\n\nThat's the best part.\n\nYou don't have to.\n\nI told Penny that you would be embarrassed, if you knew that she found out that you had lied, so she's agreed to operate as if the original lie is still in force.\n\nSo she's expecting me, to lie about going to a symposium in Pasadena, when, in actuality, we're pretending to go to a drug intervention in Long Beach.\n\nUn-unravelable.\n\nHey Penny! Wow, look at you, all ready for your showcase.\n\nYou look great.\n\nThanks.\n\nI just wanted to come by, wish you guys luck with your... symposium.\n\nThank you!\n\nI got to tell you, a lot of friends would let their friend go alone, but that's not who you are.\n\nYou are the kind of guy who stands by a friend when...\n\nWhen he has a symposium to go to.\n\nI don't know what to say.\n\nIt's okay, Leonard.\n\nOkay, all right, good.\n\nOh, boy, group hug.\n\nSo, what's up?\n\nWell, Penny is on her way to perform in a one-night showcase production of Rent, which we are unable to attend, because we're going to a symposium on molecular positronium given by Dr. Emilarmanfarmian.\n\nWait a minute. Farmanfarmian is speaking and you're bogarting the symposium?\n\nHoward, I'm sorr...\n\nNo, no, you're quark-blocking us.\n\nI don't know what to say.\n\nHoward, listen.\n\nIt's okay.\n\nIt's your Millennium Falcon.\n\nYou and Chewbacca do whatever you wanted.\n\nMe and Princess Leia here will find some other way to spend the evening.\n\nHoward, wait.\n\nSheldon,\n\nI think we should tell them.\n\nOkay, sure.\n\nI don't see a problem with that.\n\nThere's no symposium.\n\nLeonard lied to me.\n\nIsn't that right, Leonard?\n\nWell...\n\nI don't know what to say!\n\nIt's okay; I do.\n\nLeonard is helping Sheldon through a family crisis.\n\nHe made up the whole story about the symposium with Dr. Farman...\n\nFarmian.\n\nGood for you.\n\nBecause he didn't want\n\nSheldon to be embarrassed.\n\nAnd there's nothing to be embarrassed about.\n\nEvery family in America has a relative holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner.\n\nNo, I'm lost, too.\n\nI think she skipped a step.\n\nNo, look.\n\nSheldon's cousin Leo escaped rehab, and he's in a Motel 8 in Long Beach.\n\nThe whole family's going out for an intervention.\n\nLeonard is driving Sheldon down there to help him through this, because he's such a good man.\n\nAnother hug?\n\nThank you.\n\nAll right, you guys, good luck.\n\nThanks, Penny.\n\nBreak a leg!\n\nBreak a leg!\n\nSo, road trip to Long Beach.\n\nWe're not going to Long Beach.\n\nWhy not?\n\nBecause Sheldon doesn't have a drug-addicted cousin Leopold.\n\nOh, too bad.\n\nI've always wanted to go to Long Beach.\n\nIt's a very nice community.\n\nThe Queen Mary is docked there.\n\nOnce the largest ocean liner in the world, it's now a hotel and restaurant, where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner.\n\nSounds fun.\n\nI'm game.\n\nNo, no, no.\n\nLeonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front, and even then, it's iffy.\n\nWait, are we really going to Long Beach?\n\nLeonard?\n\nLet it go, Sheldon.\n\nThe murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not.\n\nNo, that's the least of our worries.\n\nI've been doing some research on addiction, both the biochemical and behavioral aspects-- and I think there's a problem with the current version of our lie.\n\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nIt's fine!\n\nShe bought it; it's over.\n\nSadly, it's not.\n\nSubstance abuse is a lifelong struggle, but beyond that, I have realized that the Leo I described  would not have agreed to go to rehab.\n\nWhy not?\n\nBecause Leo's a middle child.\n\nThere is no Leo!\n\nHow can you say that?\n\nYou didn't read the bio, did you?\n\nHe's not just a middle child, he is the quintessential middle child-- from a broken home, to boot.\n\nPsychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling, even to the point of self-destruction, is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab.\n\nI've got a solution.\n\nGreat. What is it?\n\nGet out!\n\nFine.\n\nI've hesitated to point this out, but I must now remind you that we are in our current predicament because of your initial and totally inadequate deceit.\n\nI'm just trying to clean up after your mess.\n\nWe'll talk in the morning.\n\nMorning.\n\nWho are you?\n\nI am Sheldon's cousin Leo.\n\nSheldon does not have a cousin Leo.\n\nI'm 26 years old.\n\nI'm originally from... \n\nDenton, Texas, but I was a Navy brat, so I was brought up on a variety of military bases around the world.\n\nAs a result, I've often felt like an outsider-- never really fitting in, which is probably the reason for my substance abuse problem.\n\nExcuse me, we just went over this.\n\nAs the quintessential middle child, your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention.\n\nSheldon, are we really going to go with pop psychology?\n\nFor your information, this is based on solid research.\n\nJust stick with the character profile\n\nI wrote for you.\n\nSheldon?\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nLeonard, this is Toby Loobenfeld.\n\nHe's a research assistant in the particle physics lab, but he also minored in theater at MIT.\n\nIt was more of a double major, actually.\n\nTheater and physics.\n\nYou can guess which one my bourgeois parents pushed me toward.\n\nYeah, I got it.\n\nSheldon...  why?\n\nYou see, while Leo would not have gone into rehab, it is completely plausible, that we would have talked him into leaving the motel and coming home with us.\n\nHow about this as my motivation-- when I was 14 years old,\n\nI was abused in the Philippines by a clubfooted Navy chaplain.\n\nNo. We're going with middle child and a genetic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production.\n\nSwell. How do I play genetic predisposition?\n\nSubtextually, of course.\n\nJust have fun with it.\n\nMorning, Penny.\n\nHow did the intervention go?\n\nUnfortunately, we weren't able to convince him to go to rehab.\n\nBased on what you told me,\n\nI am not surprised.\n\nBut we did convince him to leave the motel.\n\nCome say hello.\n\nLeo.\n\nThis is Penny, our friend and neighbor.\n\nHi, Leo.\n\nHow are you feeling?\n\nLet me ask you something, Penny.\n\nHave you ever woken up in a fleabag motel, covered in your own vomit, next to a transsexual prostitute?\n\nNo.\n\nThen don't ask me how I'm feeling.\n\nWell, that's Leo. why don't you tell me about your showcase last night?\n\nIt was okay, I guess.\n\nIt wasn't a big turnout, but they both really seemed to like it.\n\nThere were only two people there?\n\nBy the end, yeah.\n\nDamn you, Chaplain Harrigan!\n\nI'm... I'm sorry?\n\nThe Philippines.\n\nThe Subic Bay Naval Station.\n\nA young boy on the cusp of manhood.\n\nHis only companions, mongrel dogs and malarial mosquitoes.\n\nDesperate and alone, he reached out to a man who promised to introduce him to a merciful, loving God, but who instead introduced him to a gin-pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat.\n\nWhat choice did he have but to drink, shoot and snort his pain away?\n\nDon't forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction.\n\nThat's never been proven.\n\nThere have been studies.\n\nNot double-blind studies.\n\nHow could there be?\n\nWho would be the control group?\n\nAs you can see, detoxing can get pretty ugly.\n\nLet's give them some privacy.\n\nDo you want to come over and have coffee?\n\nAh, sounds good.\n\nI have a video of me singing last night.\n\nDo you want to see it?\n\nGee, why wouldn't I?\n\nThis is even better than you coming to the showcase, because now I get to watch you watch me.\n\nYeeaaahh.\n\nFunny how things work out. ...but he loved the companionship and the wisdom that his own father failed to provide.\n\nYour parents made the right decision.\n\nI cannot work like this.\n\nThis is amazing.\n\nJust sitting on a couch watching TV with a woman.\n\nNot being drunk or high or wondering if you're a dude down there.\n\nLeo, you are a very sweet, really funny guy.\n\nYou're going to do okay.\n\nOne day at a time, Penny.\n\nOne day at a time.\n\nHow long is he going to stay here?\n\nHe's a homeless drug addict Leonard.\n\nWhere is he going to go?\n\nBoy, you have a lot to learn about lying.\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "a4405f9e-5eec-4236-8617-45e20a6d3cc1": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4405f9e-5eec-4236-8617-45e20a6d3cc1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "39caf19254f764fed4bc360e670f87bde3772119ecf2416edc211dd14d31da1c", "text": "\n\nCheckmate.\n\nAgain?\n\nObviously, you're not well suited for three-dimensional chess.\n\nPerhaps three-dimensional Candy Land would be more your speed.\n\nJust reset the board.\n\nIt must be humbling to suck on so many different levels.\n\nHey, guys.\n\nDid you get my mail?\n\nYeah, right here.\n\nHow was Nebraska?\n\nWell, better than North Dakota.\n\nI guess that joke's only funny in Nebraska.\n\nFrom the data at hand, you really can't draw that conclusion.\n\nAll you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here.\n\nBoy, it's good to be back.\n\nHow's your family?\n\nIt was the worst trip.\n\nEveryone got sick over the weekend.\n\nSick?\n\nHere we go.\n\nWhat kind of sick?\n\nThe flu, I guess.\n\nI don't need you to guess.\n\nI need you to know.\n\nNow, when did the symptoms first appear?\n\nMaybe Friday.\n\nFriday.\n\nWas that morning or afternoon?\n\nI- I don't...\n\nThink, woman.\n\nWho blew their nose and when?\n\nSheldon, relax.\n\nShe doesn't have any symptoms.\n\nI'm sure she's not contagious.\n\nOh, please.\n\nIf influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear, it would have died out thousands of years ago.\n\nSomewhere between tool using and cave painting, homo habilis would have figured out how to kill the guy with the runny nose.\n\nPenny, you'll have to excuse Sheldon.\n\nHe's a bit of a germaphobe.\n\nIt's okay.

Never?\n\nWell, once, when I was 15, spending the summer at the Heidelberg\n\nInstitute in Germany.\n\nStudying abroad?\n\nNo. Visiting professor.\n\nAnyway, the local cuisine was a little more sausage-based than I'm used to, and the result was an internal Blitzkrieg, with my lower intestine playing the part of Czechoslovakia.\n\nAnd there was no one there to take care of you?\n\nMy Mom had to fly back to Texas to help my Dad, because the house had slipped off the cinder blocks again.\n\nAgain?\n\nIt was tornado season.\n\nAnd it was an aluminum house.\n\nThe housekeeper in the faculty residence didn't speak any English.\n\nWhen I finally managed to convince her I was sick, she said, \"Mchtest du eine Darmsplung?\"\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nBased on what happened next,\n\nI assume it means, \"Would you like an enema?\"\n\nOkay, sweetie.\n\nI'll take care of you.\n\nWhat do you need?\n\nMy Mom used to give me sponge baths.\n\nOkay, ground rules: no sponge baths, and definitely no enemas.\n\nAgreed.\n\nHere we go.\n\nTen-and-a-half hours of ape-y goodness.\n\nDamn it, my glasses.\n\nOkay, I'm blind here, guys.\n\nCan you help me find them?\n\nSorry.\n\nOkay.\n\nFound them.\n\nOh, great.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nDon't you have a spare?\n\nYeah, at home.\n\nIf you leave now, you can be back before the gorillas rip the crap out of Charlton Heston.\n\nUnless Sheldon's there, in which case, you'll be trapped forever in his whiny, hyper-neurotic snot web.\n\nHi. Penny?\n\nI was just wondering, is Sheldon still at the restaurant?\n\nOkay, that was very nice of you.\n\nOkay, I gotta go.\n\nGot kind of a full-blown\n\nChernobyl thing here. Gotta go, bye.\n\nHe's home.\n\nI'm screwed.\n\nTen-and-a-half hours of ape-y blurriness.\n\nHow about Lasik?\n\nYou want me to get eye surgery?\n\nWould you rather go home and deal with Sheldon, or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam?\n\nWell?\n\nI'm thinking.\n\nOkay, nice and cozy.\n\nOkay? I'll see you later.\n\nWait.\n\nWill you please rub this on my chest?\n\nSheldon, can't you do that yourself?\n\nVapoRub makes my hands smell funny.\n\nBut, Sheldon...\n\nPlease, please, please?\n\nI can't believe I'm doing this.\n\nNo, no. Counterclockwise, or my chest hair mats.\n\nSorry.\n\nCan you sing \"Soft Kitty\"?\n\nWhat?\n\nMy Mom used to sing it to me when I was sick.\n\nOh, sorry, honey. I don't know it.\n\nI'll teach you.\n\nNow you.\n\nKeep rubbing.\n\nWhat do you see? I can't.\n\nThe living room appears to be empty.\n\nHe must be in his bedroom.\n\nMy spare glasses are in my bedroom, on my dresser, next to my bat signal.\n\nI'm not going in there.\n\nRaj?\n\nNo way, Jose.\n\nBut I can't do it.\n\nI can't see anything.\n\nIt's all right. Wireless minicam and Bluetooth headset.\n\nWe'll be your eyes.\n\nFine.\n\nOne more thing.\n\nThis is a subsonic impact sensor.\n\nIf Sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk, this device will register it and send a signal to the laptop.\n\nAt that point, based on the geography of the apartment and the ambulatory speed of a sick Sheldon, you'll have 7 seconds to get out, glasses or no glasses.\n\nWon't my footsteps set it off?\n\nNo. You'll be on your hands and knees.\n\nYou'll need to get the sensor as close as you can to Sheldon's room.\n\nHow do I carry it if I'm on my hands and knees?\n\nStay low.\n\nBear left.\n\nNow keep true.\n\nWhat?\n\nIt means \"go straight.\"\n\nThen just say, \"Go straight.\"\n\nYou don't say, \"Go straight.\"\n\nWhen you're giving bearings, you say, \"Keep true.\"\n\nAll right.\n\nI just hit my head.\n\nBecause you didn't keep true.\n\nThe picture's breaking up.\n\nAngle your head to the right.\n\nLittle more.\n\nThat's it.\n\nNow, just keep true.\n\nYou're close enough to Sheldon's room.\n\nDeploy the sensor.\n\nIt wasn't on?\n\nThen why did I have to crawl?\n\nNo, I guess you didn't.\n\nGood. From this point forward, you will have to crawl.\n\nI know.\n\nHang on, the sensor's picking up something. Turn your head back.\n\nYou rat bastard.\n\nTold you the sensor would work.\n\nYou deliberately stuck me with Sheldon.\n\nCome on, I had to.\n\nYou see what he's like?\n\nPenny, I'm hungry.\n\nIt's okay, sweetie.\n\nGood news! Leonard's home!\n\nHere you go.\n\nGood luck. Bye.\n\nLeonard! I'm hungry!\n\nPenny, take me with you!\n\nI want grilled cheese.\n\nDo you think Penny will come here and take care of us?\n\nI don't think Penny's ever coming here again.\n\nI'm very congested.\n\nYeah? So?\n\nCould you go to the kitchen and get me the turkey baster labeled \"mucous\"?\n\nIf I stand, I'll vomit.\n\nUnder the sink, yellow Tupper Ware bowl.\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "081c5d16-23f9-4630-9baa-f9b2cd5b3f6d": {"__data__": {"id_": "081c5d16-23f9-4630-9baa-f9b2cd5b3f6d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "1a03755e91b21aa4c4d1a935d516b77c8b7fd89afd2b2aafb5d21273094e85d6", "text": "\n\nHere's the problem with teleportation.\n\nLay it on me.\n\nAssuming a device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly, you would not have transported the individual.\n\nYou would have destroyed him in one location and recreated him in another.\n\nHow about that.\n\nPersonally,\n\nI would never use a transporter, because the original Sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new Sheldon.\n\nWould the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old Sheldon?\n\nNo, he would be exactly the same.\n\nThat is a problem.\n\nSo you see it too.\n\nDr. Hofstadter. Dr. Cooper.\n\nDr. Gablehauser.\n\nGentlemen, I'd like you to meet Dennis Kim.\n\nDennis is a highly sought-after doctoral candidate, and we're hoping he'll do his graduate work here.\n\nGraduate work. Very impressive.\n\nAnd he's only 15 years old.\n\nNot bad... I, myself, started graduate school at 14.\n\nWell, I lost a year while my family was tunneling out of North Korea.\n\nAdvantage: Kim.\n\nI thought maybe you boys could show Dennis around.\n\nLet him see why we're the best physics research facility in the country.\n\nI already know you're not.\n\nYou don't have an Open Science Grid computer or a free electron laser.\n\nThe string theory research being done here is nothing but a dead end.\n\nExcuse me, that is my research, and it is by no means a dead end.\n\nObviously you don't see it yet, but trust me, you will.\n\nDennis, we've discussed this.\n\nWe're in the process of updating our equipment, and we welcome your input on our research goals.\n\nWe've agreed to look the other way if you use up to 20% of the grant money you attract to smuggle your grandfather out of Pyongyang.\n\nWe want him here, boys.\n\nMake it happen.\n\nYes, sir.\n\nYou can count on us.\n\nWe're on it.\n\nWhat the hell do you mean, \"dead end\"?\n\nI mean, the whole landscape of false vacuums in string theory could be as large as 10 to the 500th power. In addition...\n\nLook, chocolate milk.\n\nI sense a disturbance in the Force.\n\nA bad feeling I have about this.\n\nSeason 1 Episode 12:\n\nThe Jerusalem Duality\n\nDennis, how long have you been in America?\n\nA year and a half.\n\nNo kidding.\n\nYou speak English really well.\n\nSo do you.\n\nExcept for your tendency to end sentences with prepositions.\n\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nThat.\n\nHe's not wrong.\n\nAll right... And this is my office.\n\nIs this part of the tour?\n\nNope. Goodbye.\n\nSheldon, we've hardly shown him anything.\n\nAll right. This is my desk.\n\nThese are my books; this is my door.\n\nPlease close it behind you. Goodbye.\n\nLooks like you're doing work in quantum loop corrections.\n\nKeen observation. Goodbye.\n\nYou see where you went wrong, don't you?\n\nGet him out.\n\nCome on. I'll show you the rec center.\n\nThey've got Nautilus equipment.\n\nDo I look like I lift weights?\n\nNot heavy ones.\n\nIt's startling you haven't considered a Lorentz invariant or field theory approach.\n\nYou think I haven't considered it?\n\nYou really think\n\nI haven't considered it?\n\nHave you considered it?\n\nGet him out, Leonard.\n\nCome on, Dennis.\n\nI'll show you the radiation lab.\n\nYou won the Stevenson Award?\n\nYes. In fact, I am the youngest person ever to win it.\n\nReally? How old?\n\nFourteen and a half.\n\nYou were the youngest person ever to win it.\n\nIt's like looking into an obnoxious little mirror, isn't it?\n\nThis is really delicious, isn't it?\n\nStill can't talk to me unless you're drunk, huh?\n\nSweetie, you are so damaged.\n\nHey, I'm damaged, too.\n\nHow about a hug for Howie?\n\nSure. Raj, hug Howard.\n\nSomething you'd like to share?\n\nA tale of woe, perhaps?\n\nDennis Kim is 15 years old, and he's already correcting my work.\n\nToday, I went from being\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart, to...\n\nYou know, that other guy.\n\nAntonio Salieri?\n\nOh God, now even you are smarter than me.\n\nYou know, you don't have so many friends that you can afford to start insulting them.\n\nJust eat, Sheldon, you'll feel better.\n\nWhy waste food?\n\nIn Texas, when a cow goes dry, they don't keep feeding it, they just... take her out and shoot her between the eyes.\n\nI'm confused.\n\nDid Sheldon stop giving milk?\n\nYou can't let this kid get to you.\n\nYou always knew that someday someone younger and smarter would come along.\n\nYes, but I assumed I would've been dead hundreds of years and that there'd be an asterisk by his name because he'd be a cyborg.\n\nSo you've got a little competition.\n\nI really don't see what the big deal is.\n\nOf course you don't.\n\nYou've never excelled at anything.\n\nI don't understand exactly how did he get any friends in the first place?\n\nWe liked Leonard.\n\nWhat are you gonna do, just give up?\n\nIt's what a rational person does when his entire life's work is invalidated by a postpubescent Asian wunderkind.\n\nHe ceases his fruitless efforts, he donates his body to scientific research, and he waits to die.\n\nI'm confused again.\n\nIs he waiting, or do we get to shoot him between the eyes?\n\nI've decided you're right.\n\nMy career is not over.\n\nGreat!\n\nSince the arrival of Dennis Kim has rendered my research pointless,\n\nI just have to find something else to focus on.\n\nGreat!\n\nSo I've decided.\n\nI'm going to collaborate with you.\n\nGreat.\n\nSo what exactly is it you do?\n\nYou chatter on about it all the time, but I've never really paid attention.\n\nRight now, I'm designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at see level, but I really don't need any help.\n\nSure you do.\n\nSee, what's this here in the schematic?\n\nIs that a laser array?\n\nYes.\n\nNow...\n\nWhat happens if you use argon lasers instead of helium-neon?\n\nIt would blow up.\n\nAre you sure?\n\nPretty sure. \"Pretty sure\" is not very scientific.\n\nIs this how you normally work?\n\nJust hunches and guesses and stuff?\n\nI understand that you're going through a bit of a career cris, you're searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive, but I need to tell you something.\n\nI want you to listen carefully.\n\nAll right.\n\nGo away.\n\nIf you're concerned about sharing credit with me, your name can go first...\n\nI'm going.\n\nIt's a small, brown paper bag, Ma!\n\nI'm looking in it right now.\n\nWhy would I make that up?\n\nThere's no Ding Dong in it.\n\nHow are two Ding Dongs tomorrow gonna help me today?\n\nSo...\n\nThis is Engineering, huh?\n\nI'll talk to you later.\n\nEngineering.\n\nWhere the noble semiskilled laborers execute the vision of those who think and dream.\n\nHello, Oompa-Loompas of science.\n\nSheldon, what are you doing here?\n\nI just came by to say hello.\n\nI've been in this lab for 3 years.\n\nYou've never come by to say hello.\n\nUp until now,\n\nI've had better things to do.\n\nSo, what are we making today?\n\nA small payload support structure for a European science experimental package that's going up on a space shuttle.\n\nReally? How does it work?\n\nWhen this is done, it will be attached to the payload bay, and the sensor apparatus will rest on it.\n\nSo, it's a shelf.\n\nNo, you don't understand.\n\nDuring acceleration, it needs to stay perfectly level and provide...\n\nYeah, it's a shelf.\n\nI notice you're using titanium.\n\nDid you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes?\n\nThey're lighter, cheaper, and have twice the tensile strength.\n\nThere's a diploma in my office that says I have a master's in engineering.\n\nYou also have a note from your mother that says, \"I love you, Bubula.\"\n\nBut neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes.\n\nGo away!\n\nDid Leonard tell you to say that?\n\nNo, I thought of it all by myself.\n\nThat can't be a coincidence.\n\nThere must be some causal link I'm missing.\n\nGo away!\n\nCuriouser and curiouser.\n\nIs he here?\n\nIf he were, I wouldn't be.\n\nDo you know what he did?\n\nHe watched me work for 10 min, and then started to design a simple piece of software that could replace me.\n\nIs that even possible?\n\nAs it turns out, yes.\n\nSomething's got to be done about him.\n\nLike what? He'll never be able to cope with the fact that some 15-year-old kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is.\n\nWhat if something happened to this boy so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?\n\nThen our problem would be solved.\n\nHang on, are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim?\n\nI'm not saying no.\n\nWe don't have to go that far.\n\nThere are other means available.\n\nWe can't send him back to North Korea.\n\nHe knows how to get out.\n\nThe only thing we need to do is make this Kim kid lose his focus.\n\nWon't happen. He is not interested in anything but physics.\n\nWhat about biology?\n\nWhat?\n\nYou know, biology.\n\nThe one thing that can completely derail a world-class mind.\n\nHe's 15.\n\nYeah, so? When I was 15,\n\nI met Denise Palmeri and my grade point average fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8.\n\nShe was sleeping with you?\n\nNo, I just... wasted a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if she did.\n\nOh, good, you're all here.\n\nLook, if the three of you drop whatever it is you're working on and join me, we could lick cold fusion in less than a decade. 12 years, tops.\n\nGo away?\n\nCould it be me?\n\nWhat's up?\n\nWe need a hot 15-year-old Asian girl with a thing for smart guys.\n\nWhat?\n\nHoward, that's racist.\n\nAny 15-year-old girl will do the trick.\n\nIt's possible she may have misunderstood us.\n\nDr. Cooper.\n\nAre we interrupting?\n\nNo, please come in.\n\nI think you'll appreciate this.\n\nThis is very exciting.\n\nWhat are you working on?\n\nSomething remarkable.\n\nSince my prospects for the Nobel prize in physics have disappeared thank you very much,\n\nI've decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win the Nobel peace prize.\n\nI will solve the Middle East crisis by building an exact replica of Jerusalem in the middle of the Mexican desert.\n\nTo what end?\n\nIt's like the baseball movie. \"Build it and they will come.\"\n\nWho will come?\n\nThe Jewish people.\n\nWhat if they don't come?\n\nWe'll make it nice, put out a spread.\n\nOkay, well, speaking of spreads, we're having a small welcoming party this afternoon for Mr. Kim who's agreed to join us here at the university.\n\nOf course he has.\n\nThe Oracle told us little Neo was the one.\n\nYou can see the matrix, can't you?\n\nWell, obviously you're very busy with your...\n\nCome, Dennis.\n\nYou'll have to excuse Dr. Cooper.\n\nHe's been under a lot of...\n\nHe's nuts.\n\nThey'll come, they'll settle, and I'll win the prize.\n\nI really don't understand your objections, professor Goldfarb.\n\nWhy wouldn't the Sonora desert make a perfectly good promised land?\n\nGo away.\n\nWe could call it Nuevo Jerusalem.\n\nPlease go away.\n\nSaid Pharaoh to Moses.\n\nWhy are all these young women here?\n\nIt's Take Your Daughter To Work Day.\n\nReally?\n\nI was not aware of that.\n\nYes. There was a very official e-mail sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16.\n\nSmooth.\n\nThank you.\n\nThere's the man of the hour.\n\nOkay, so we now have a socially-awkward genius in a room full of attractive, age-appropriate women.\n\nAll he has to do now is hook up with one of them.\n\nAnyone else see the flaw in this plan?\n\nWe need a social catalyst.\n\nLike what?\n\nWe can't get 15-year-old girls drunk.\n\nOr can we?\n\nNo, we can't.\n\nI don't think you mean \"we can't.\"\n\nI think you mean \"we shouldn't.\"\n\nYou're a Jew.\n\nIf there was another Wailing Wall exactly like the one in Jerusalem but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs, would you still be able to wail at it?\n\nOkay, it's definitely me.\n\nWe cannot leave this to chance.\n\nLet's pick a girl and figure out how to get her together with Dennis.\n\nHow about that one?\n\nI know the type.\n\nCheerleader, student council, goes out with the jocks, won't even look at anybody in the gifted program.\n\nIf after 2 years of begging, she agrees to go out with you, it turns out to be a setup and you're in your mom's car with your pants off while the whole football team laughs at y...\n\nAre you crying?\n\nNo, I have allergies.\n\nOkay...\n\nHow about her?\n\nSure, if he wants to spend two years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with nonfat White Russians.\n\nYou're holding her head out of the toilet while she's puking and telling you she wishes \"more guys were like you.\"\n\nThen she gets into Cornell because you wrote her essay for her and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn't even know you.\n\nOkay, so not her, either.\n\nHow about her?\n\nInteresting, kind of pretty, a little chubby, so probably low self-esteem.\n\nI think that's our girl.\n\nOne of us should go talk to her.\n\nI can't talk to her... you do it.\n\nI can't just go up and talk to her.\n\nHoward, you talk to her.\n\nShe'll never go for the kid once she gets a peek at this.\n\nIn India, this would be simpler. and a laptop, and we'd be done.\n\nWe're not in India.\n\nWhy don't we do it your way then?\n\nWe'll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from Dennis so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end.\n\nOkay, that was uncalled for.\n\nYou started it, dude.\n\nCould I have everyone's attention, please?\n\nWhat a wonderful occasion this is, and how fortunate that it should happen to fall on Take Your Daughter to Work Day.\n\nWe're here to welcome\n\nMr. Dennis Kim to our little family.\n\nWelcome, Dennis Kim.\n\nMr. Kim was not only the valedictorian at Stanford University, he is also the youngest recipient of the prestigious Stevenson Award.\n\nYoungest till the cyborgs rise up!\n\nAnd now, without any further ado, let me introduce the man of the hour,\n\nMr. Dennis Kim.\n\nWhat?!\n\nWould you like to tell us a little bit about your upcoming research?\n\nNo, thanks.\n\nI'm going to the mall with Emma.\n\nThe kid got a girl.\n\nUnbelievable.\n\nDid anyone see how he did it?\n\nDon't worry, I've got this.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, honored daughters, while Mr. Kim, by virtue of his youth and naivete, has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact, let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted, and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me.\n\nThank you.\n\nHe's back.\n\nMission accomplished.\n\nForget the mission. How did that little yutz get a girl on his own?\n\nI guess times have changed since we were young.\n\nSmart is the new sexy.\n\nThen why do we go home alone every night? We're still smart.\n\nMaybe we're too smart.\n\nSo smart it's off-putting.\n\nYeah, let's go with that.\n\nUnbelievable.\n\nComponents I built are on the International Space Station and I get a ticket for launching a model rocket in the park.\n\nI don't know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman, \"You have to frisk me.\n\nI have another rocket in my pants.\"\n\nLook at that.\n\nIt's Dennis Kim.\n\nI almost didn't recognize him.\n\nI kind of feel bad about what we did to him.\n\nYeah, we really ruined his life.\n\nScrew him...\n\nHe was weak.\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "23adb347-1888-4828-96f3-31eee387eae3": {"__data__": {"id_": "23adb347-1888-4828-96f3-31eee387eae3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "7f1d8ba2104a2448e8b54db13a51627f97817d98a0d67180e346319382c39c1e", "text": "\n\nMore details about the new <i>Star Trek</i> film.\n\nThere's going to be a scene depicting Spock's birth.\n\nI'd be more interested in a scene depicting Spock's conception.\n\nOh, please.\n\nFor Vulcans, mating... or if you will, PonFahr... it's an extremely private matter.\n\nStill, I'd like to know the details.\n\nHis mother was human.\n\nHis father is Vulcan.\n\nThey couldn't just conceive.\n\nMaybe they had to go to a clinic.\n\nCan you imagine Spock's Dad in a little room with a copy of\n\nPointy Ears and Shapely Rears.\n\nHow come on <i>Star Trek</i> everybody's private parts are the same?\n\nNo alien lady ever told Captain Kirk, \"Hey, get your thing out of my nose.\"\n\nHi.

It's vanilla oil.\n\nI was actually the one who noticed.\n\nOkay, let's just start.\n\nOkay, the first question is on the topic of optics. \"What is the shortest light pulse ever produced?\"\n\nDr. Cooper.\n\nAnd of course, the answer is 130 attoseconds.\n\nThat is correct.\n\nI knew that, too.\n\nGood for you, sweetie.\n\nOkay, next question: \"What is the quantum mechanical effect \"used to encode data on hard-disk drives?\"\n\nAnd of course the answer is giant magnetoresistance.\n\nRight.\n\nHey, I buzzed in.\n\nAnd I answered.\n\nIt's called teamwork.\n\nDon't you think I should answer the engineering questions?\n\nI am an engineer.\n\nBy that logic I should answer all the anthropology questions because I'm a mammal.\n\nJust ask another one. \"What artificial satellite has seen glimpses of Einstein's predicted frame dragging?\"\n\nAnd of course, it's Gravity Probe B.\n\nSheldon, you have to let somebody else answer.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause it's polite.\n\nWhat do manners have to do with it?\n\nThis is war.\n\nWere the Romans polite when they salted the ground of Carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again?\n\nLeonard, you said\n\nI only had to ask questions.\n\nThe objective of the competion is to give correct answers.\n\nIf I know them, why shouldn't I give them?\n\nSome of us might have the correct answers, too.\n\nOh, please.\n\nYou don't even have a PhD.\n\nAll right, that's it!\n\nHoward, sit down.\n\nMaybe we should take a little break.\n\nGood idea. I need my wrist brace.\n\nAll this button-pushing is aggravating my old Nintendo injury.\n\nI agree.\n\nWhat did he say?\n\nHe compared Sheldon to a disposable feminine cleansing product one might use on a summer's eve.\n\nYeah, and the bag it came in.\n\nLeonard, excellent.\n\nI want to show you something.\n\nCan it wait?\n\nI need to talk to you.\n\nJust look. I've designed the perfect uniforms for our team.\n\nThe colors are based on <i>Star Trek: The Original Series</i>.\n\nThe three of you will wear Support Red, and I will wear Command Gold.\n\nWhy do they say \"AA\"?\n\nArmy Ants.\n\nIsn't that confusing? \"AA\" might mean something else to certain people.\n\nWhy would a Physics Bowl team be called Anodized Aluminum?\n\nNo, I meant...\n\nNever mind.\n\nCheck it out,\n\nI got you a <i>Batman</i> cookie jar.\n\nOh, neat!\n\nWhat's the occasion?\n\nWell, you're a friend, and you like <i>Batman</i> and cookies, and you're off the team.\n\nWhat?\n\nHoward, Raj and I just had a team meeting.\n\nNo, you didn't.\n\nYes, we did. I just came from there.\n\nOkay, I don't know where you just came from, but it could'nt have been a team meeting because I wasn't there.\n\nErgo, the team did not meet.\n\nOkay, let me try it this way:\n\nI was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends, and one thing led to another, and it turns out you're off the team.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause you're taking all the fun out of it.\n\nI'm sorry, is the winner of the Physics\n\nBowl the team that has the most fun?\n\nOkay, let me try it this way:\n\nYou're annoying and no one wants to play with you anymore.\n\nI see.\n\nAt this point I should inform you that I intend to form my own team and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears.\n\nThanks for the heads-up.\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOne more thing.\n\nYes?\n\nIt's on, bitch.\n\nSo who'd he get to be on his team?\n\nHe won't say.\n\nHe just smiles and eats macaroons out of his bat jar.\n\nHe's using psychological warfare.\n\nWe must reply in kind.\n\nI say we wait until he looks at us, then laugh like, \"Yes, you are a smart and strong competitor, \"but we are also smart and strong, and we have a reasonable chance of defeating you.\"\n\nHow exactly would that laugh go?\n\nThat sounds more like, \"We are a tall, thin woman who wants to make a coat out of your Dalmatians.\"\n\nLet's remember that Sheldon is still our friend and my roommate.\n\nSo?\n\nSo nothing.\n\nLet's destroy him.\n\nGentlemen.\n\nWe're going to need a strong fourth for our team.\n\nYou know who is apparently very smart is the girl who played <i>TV's Blossom</i>.\n\nShe got a PhD. in neuroscience or something.\n\nRaj, we're not getting <i>TV's Blossom</i> to join our Physics Bowl team.\n\nHow about the girl from <i>The Wonder Years</i>?\n\nGentlemen, I believe I've found the solution to all our problems.\n\nWe can't ask Leslie Winkle.\n\nWhy? Because you slept together, and when she was done with you she discarded you like last night's chutney?\n\nYes.\n\nSometimes you've got to take one for the team.\n\nSack up, dude.\n\nFine.\n\nHere I go, taking one for the team... in the sack.\n\nHey, Leslie.\n\nHi, guys.\n\nSo, Leslie,\n\nI have a question for you, and it might be a little awkward, you know, given that I...\n\nHit that thing.\n\nLeonard, there's no reason to feel uncomfortable just because we've seen each other's faces and naked bodies contorted in the sweet agony of coitus.\n\nThere's not?\n\nGee, 'cause it sure sounds like there should be.\n\nRest assured that any aspects of our sexual relationship regarding your preferences, your idiosyncrasies, your performance are still protected by the inherent confidentiality of the bedroom.\n\nThat's all very comforting, but if it's okay,\n\nI'd like to get on to my question now.\n\nProceed.\n\nWe are entering the Physics Bowl, and we need a fourth for our team.\n\nNo, thanks. I'm really busy with my like-sign dilepton supersymmetry search.\n\nDilepton, shmylepton.\n\nWe need you.\n\nSorry.\n\nWell, we tried.\n\nWe'll just have to face Sheldonmano y mano y mano a mano.\n\nWait, you're going up against Sheldon Cooper?\n\nThat arrogant, misogynistic,\n\nEast Texas doorknob that told me I should abandon my work with high-energy particles for laundry and childbearing?\n\nShe's in.\n\nSo, how do you feel?\n\nNice and loose? Come to play?\n\nGot your game face on?\n\nAre you ready?\n\nYeah. You know, you don't have to stay for the whole thing.\n\nOh, no. I want to.\n\nSounds really interesting.\n\nGentlemen.\n\nI'm just gonna sit down.\n\nSo, is that your team?\n\nActually, I don't need a team.\n\nI could easily defeat you single-handedly, but the rules require four.\n\nSo, may I introduce the third-floor janitor, the lady from the lunch room, and my Spanish is not good... either her son or her butcher.\n\nAnd what about your team?\n\nWhat rat have you recruited to the S.S. Sinking Ship?\n\nHello, Sheldon.\n\nLeslie Winkle.\n\nYeah, Leslie Winkle.\n\nThe answer to the question, \"Who made Sheldon Cooper cry like a little girl?\"\n\nWell, I'm polymerized tree sap, and you're an inorganic adhesive.\n\nSo whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me, returns on its original trajectory and adheres to you.\n\nOh, ouch!\n\nOkay, if everyone could please take your seats.\n\nHere's your T-shirt.\n\nPMS?\n\nIt's a couple days early...\n\nIt stands for \"Perpetual Motion Squad.\"\n\nOf course.\n\nWhat was I thinking?\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and welcome to this year's Physics Bowl!\n\nToday's preliminary match features two great teams.\n\nAA versus...\n\nPMS.\n\nAll night long, y'all!\n\nOkay, well, let's jump right in.\n\nFirst question for ten points: \"What is the iso-spin singlet partner \"of the pi-zero meson?\"\n\nPMS?\n\nThe eta meson.\n\nCorrect.\n\nFormal protest.\n\nOn what grounds?\n\nThe Velcro on my wrist brace caught on my shirt.\n\nDenied.\n\nAll right, for ten points, \"What is the lightest element on Earth \"with no stable isotope?\"\n\nAA?\n\nAnd of course, the answer is technetium.\n\nTerrific.\n\nNext question: \"What is the force between two uncharged plates \"due to quantum vacuum fluctuations?\"\n\nPMS?\n\nSheldon can suck on... the Casimir effect.\n\nCorrect.\n\nHow does a quantum computer factor large numbers?\n\nPMS?\n\nShor's algorithm.\n\nCorrect! to the seventh ergs per calorie.\n\nPrevost's theory of exchanges.\n\nLambda equals one over pi r squared n. the approximate temperature of the young lady in the front row.\n\nMr. Wolowitz, this is your second warning.\n\nA sigma particle.\n\nYes, assuming the hypothetical planet has a mass greater than the Earth.\n\nCorrect!\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nI hold in my hand the final question.\n\nThe score now stands.\n\nAA: 1,150,\n\nPMS: 1,175.\n\nSo, for 100 points and the match, please turn your attention to the formula on the screens.\n\nSolve the equation.\n\nHoly crap.\n\nWhat the hell is that?\n\nLooks like something they found on the ship at Roswell.\n\nCome on. Think.\n\nLeslie?\n\nIt's not gonna work if you rush me.\n\nYou have to let me get there.\n\nYou are never gonna let that go, are you?\n\nTen seconds.\n\nPMS?\n\nSorry, I panicked.\n\nThen guess.\n\nEight. .4\n\nI'm sorry, that's incorrect.\n\nAA, if you can answer correctly, the match is yours.\n\nHe doesn't have it.\n\nHe's got squat.\n\nAA, I need your answer.\n\nThe answer is minus eight pi alpha.\n\nHang on a second.\n\nThat's not our answer.\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\nAnswering question.\n\nWinning Physics Bowl.\n\nHow do you know anything about physics?\n\nHere I am janitor.\n\nIn former Soviet Union, I am physicist.\n\nLeningrad Politechnika.\n\nGo Polar Bears.\n\nThat's a delightful little story, but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything...\n\nI answer the questions.\n\nYou didn't answer question.\n\nLook, now, maybe you have democracy now in your beloved Russia, but on this Physics Bowl team,\n\nI rule with an iron fist.\n\nAA, I need your official answer.\n\nIt's not what he said.\n\nThen what is it?\n\nI want a different question.\n\nYou can't.\n\nFormal protest.\n\nDenied.\n\nInformal protest.\n\nDenied.\n\nI need your official answer.\n\nNo. I decline to provide one.\n\nThat's too bad because the answer your teammate gave was correct.\n\nThat's your opinion.\n\nThe winner of the match is...\n\nHang on.\n\nIs proving that you are single-handedly smarter than everyone else so important that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team?\n\nI don't understand the question.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nThe winner is PMS.\n\nSorry, somebody's sitting there.\n\nWho?\n\nMy Physics Bowl trophy.\n\nThat trophy is meaningless.\n\nI forfeited, therefore you did not win.\n\nI know someone who would disagree.\n\nWho?\n\nMy Physics Bowl trophy.\n\nLeonard is so smart.\n\nSheldon who?\n\nAll right, that is very immature.\n\nYou're right. I'm sorry.\n\nI'm not!\n\nOkay, new contest.\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\nI am settling once and for all who is the smartest around here, okay?\n\nReady?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nBring it on. \"Marsha, Jan and Cindy were the three daughters \"in what TV family?\" \"Sammy Hagar replaced David Lee Roth as the lead singer in what group?\" \"Madonna was married to this Ridgemont High alum.\"\n\nOh, my God! Sean Penn!\n\nHow do you know these things?\n\nI go outside, and I talk to people.\n\nOkay, here. \"What actor holds the record \"for being named <i>People Magazine</i>'s\n\nSexiest Man Alive?\"\n\nWilliam Shatner.\n\nWait.\n\nI don't think it's Shatner.\n\nThen it's got to be Patrick Stewart.\n\nFormal protest. \"Singer who sang, \"Tweetie Bird tought he taw a what?\"\n\nRomulan.\n\nYes.\n\nHe tought he taw a Romulan.\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "573f8d71-cabf-496c-9a71-8ad7f402c140": {"__data__": {"id_": "573f8d71-cabf-496c-9a71-8ad7f402c140", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "c708d0b2a29cd909a0f13773fbb846780058e5d997c9615f46f52e6778905b65", "text": "\n\nThis sandwich is an unmitigated disaster.\n\nI asked for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and Swiss on whole wheat.\n\nWhat did they give you?\n\nTurkey and roast beef with Swiss and lettuce on whole wheat.\n\nIt's the right ingredients, but in the wrong order.\n\nIn a proper sandwich, the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce.\n\nThey might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash.\n\nI don't believe it.\n\nI know. It's basic culinary science.\n\nSome guy is auctioning off a miniature Time Machine prop from the original film, and no one is bidding on it.\n\nA time machine from the movie <i>The Time Machine</i>?\n\nNo. A time machine from <i>Sophie's Choice</i>.\n\nBoy, Sophie could have used a time machine in that movie.\n\nDid you see it? It's rough.\n\nThat's cool.\n\nIt's only $800?\n\nYeah. And that's my bid.\n\nYou bid $800?\n\nIt was a spur-of-the-moment thing.\n\nI figured it would go for thousands, and I just wanted to be a part of it.\n\nThere's only 30 sec left in the auction.\n\nDo you have $800?\n\nNot to blow on a miniature time machine.\n\nDon't worry. People wait until the last second to bid, and they swoop in and get it.\n\nIt's called sniping.\n\nCome on, snipers.\n\nWhere are your snipers?\n\nSnipe.\n\nSnipe.\n\nSnipe!\n\nSnipe!\n\nCongratulations!\n\nYou are the proud owner of a miniature time machine!\n\nYou lucky duck.\n\nI wonder why no one else bid.\n\nThis is a classic piece of sci-fi movie memorabilia.\n\nYeah, I know! I still can't afford it.\n\nWhy don't we share it?\n\nWe'll each put in 200 bucks, we'll take turns having it in our house.\n\nA time-share time machine.\n\nI'm in. Sheldon?\n\nNeed you ask?\n\nI still don't understand why no one else bid.\n\nI understand why no one else bid.\n\nSeason 1 Episode 14: \n\nThe Nerdvana Annihilation\n\nDid the listing actually say \"miniature\"?\n\nI just assumed.\n\nWho sells a full-size time machine for $800?\n\nIn a Venn diagram, that would be an individual located within the intersection of the sets \"No longer want my time machine\" and \"Need $800.\"\n\nIt's actually a tremendous bargain.\n\nEven with shipping, it works out to less than four dollars a pound.\n\nCocktail shrimp are $12.50.\n\nHow are we going to get it upstairs?\n\nIf we take the dish off, it might fit in the elevator.\n\nYes, but the elevator has been broken for 2 years.\n\nI've been meaning to ask you.\n\nDo you think we should make a call about that?\n\nNot necessary.\n\nI have a Master's in engineering.\n\nI remotely repair satellites on a regular basis.\n\nI troubleshoot space shuttle payloads.\n\nWhen the Mars Rover started pulling to the left,\n\nI performed a front-end alignment from 62 million miles away.\n\nNo. That baby's broken.\n\nCome on, guys! Push!\n\nIf I push any harder,\n\nI'm going to give birth to my colon.\n\nI can't feel my fingers. Hurry up!\n\nIt's the same amount of work no matter how fast you go.\n\nBasic physics.\n\nSheldon?\n\nIf my fingers ever work again,\n\nI've got a job for the middle one.\n\nHey, guys.\n\nHi, Penny.\n\nTake a break, guys.\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\nWe're just moving something upstairs.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nJust...\n\nYou know. Time machine.\n\nNeat. But I really got to get to work.\n\nGive us a few minutes.\n\nI don't have them. I'm running late.\n\nThen, I have a simple solution.\n\nGo up to the roof.\n\nHop over to the next building.\n\nThere's a small gap, don't look down if you're subject to vertigo, and use their stairwell.\n\nYou're joking, right?\n\nI never joke when it comes to vertigo.\n\nDamn. Okay, I'll just take the roof.\n\nIf you wait for us to set up the time machine,\n\nI can drop you off at work yesterday.\n\nTime travel joke.\n\nIt's not... never mind.\n\nFor what it's worth,\n\nI thought it was humorous.\n\nLet's just do this.\n\nYou guys ready to push?\n\nIn a minute.\n\nHoward stepped outside to throw up.\n\nI don't know what you were worried about.\n\nI think it really works in the room.\n\nIt is by far the coolest thing\n\nI have ever owned.\n\nThe exact time machine that carried actor Rod Taylor from Victorian England into the post-apocalyptic future, where society had splintered into two factions: the subterranean Morlocks, who survived by feasting on the flesh of the gentle surface-dwelling Eloi.\n\nTalk about your chick magnets.\n\nThe guy who lives next to me is always like, \"I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony.\n\nI have a Jacuzzi on my balcony.\"\n\nBut wait until I tell him, \"I've got a time machine on my balcony.\n\nStuff that in your Speedoes,\n\nJacuzzi Bob.\"\n\nGentlemen, we said we'd take turns, but I think you'll agree that practicality dictates it remain here.\n\nYou can't keep it here.\n\nWhat if I meet a girl and say, \"You wanna come up and see my time machine?\n\nIt's at my friends' house.\"\n\nHow lame is that?\n\nHe's got a point.\n\nI think we're going to need some ground rules; in addition to the expected \"no shoes in the time machine,\" and \"no eating in the time machine,\"\n\nI propose we add \"pants must be worn at all times in the time machine.\"\n\nSeconded.\n\nI was going to put down a towel.\n\nI still want it on my balcony.\n\nI say we move it on a bi-monthly basis.\n\nThat sounds fair.\n\nBi-monthly is an ambiguous term.\n\nIt's every other month or twice a month?\n\nTwice a month.\n\nThen no.\n\nOkay, every other month.\n\nNo.\n\nYou can't be selfish.\n\nWe all paid for it, so it belongs to all of us.\n\nNow get out of the way so I can sit in my time machine.\n\nI am setting the dials for March 10, 1876.\n\nGood choice, Alexander Graham Bell invents the telephone and calls out for Dr. Watson.\n\nWait a minute.\n\nI'd want to see that, too.\n\nSo when it's your turn, you can.\n\nBut if we all go back to the same point,\n\nBell's lab is going to get very crowded.\n\nHe'll know something's up.\n\nAlso since the time machine doesn't move in space, you'll end up in 1876 Pasadena.\n\nAnd even if you can make it to Boston, are you going knock on the door and say to Mrs. Bell, \"Big fan of your husband. \"Can I come in and watch him invent the telephone?\"\n\nMrs. Bell was deaf.\n\nShe's not even going to hear you knock.\n\nI have a solution.\n\nFirst, go into the future and obtain a cloaking device.\n\nHow far into the future?\n\nIf I remember correctly, Captain Kirk will steal a cloaking device from the Romulans on Stardate 5027.3, which would be January 10, 2328 by pre-Federation reckoning.\n\nI am setting the dials for January 10, 2328.\n\nHere we go into the future.\n\nThat was fun.\n\nMy turn!\n\nOkay, first of all, what you call a gap was nearly three feet wide.\n\nI slipped and skinned my knee.\n\nAre you okay?\n\nSecond of all, the door to the stairwell of the other building was locked, so I had to go down the fire escape, which ends on the 3d floor, forcing me to crawl through the window of a lovely Armenian family who insisted I stay for lunch.\n\nThat doesn't sound too bad.\n\nIt was eight courses of lamb, and they tried to fix me up with their son.\n\nSorry.\n\nNot done.\n\nBy the time I finally got to work, they'd given my shift away.\n\nThat's right. I lost an entire day's pay thanks to this.\n\nThis...\n\nTime machine.\n\nThe lights flash and the dish spins.\n\nYou want to try it?\n\nI don't want to try it!\n\nMy God, you are grown men!\n\nHow can you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes and comic books and now that?! That...\n\nAgain. Time machine.\n\nPlease, it's not a time machine.\n\nIf anything, it looks like something\n\nElton John would drive through the Everglades.\n\nIt only moves in time.\n\nIt would be worse than useless in a swamp.\n\nPathetic! All of you!\n\nCompletely pathetic!\n\nMy turn!\n\nLeonard, it's 2:00 in the morning.\n\nSo?\n\nSo it's my turn.\n\nWhy did you set it for the day before yesterday?\n\nBecause I want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine.\n\nYou can't.\n\nIf you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past, you wouldn't have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it.\n\nErgo, you would still have it.\n\nThis is a classic rookie time-travel mistake.\n\nCan I go back and prevent you from explaing that to me?\n\nSame paradox.\n\nIf you were to travel back in time and, say, knock me unconscious, you would not then have the conversation that irritated you, motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious.\n\nWhat if I knocked you unconscious right now?\n\nIt won't change the past.\n\nBut it'd make the present so much nicer.\n\nAre you upset about something?\n\nWhat was your first clue?\n\nWell, it was a number of things.\n\nFirst, the late hour.\n\nThen your demeanor seems very low-energy, plus your irritability.\n\nYes, I'm upset!\n\nI don't usually pick up on those things.\n\nGood for me.\n\nGood for you.\n\nWait.\n\nDid you want to talk about what's bothering you?\n\nI don't know. Maybe.\n\nI'm on fire tonight.\n\nHere's the thing.\n\nGirls like Penny never end up with guys who own time machines.\n\nI disagree.\n\nYour inability to successfully woo Penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine.\n\nThat failure clearly stands on its own.\n\nThanks for pointing it out.\n\nIn addition, your premise is flawed.\n\nIn the original film,\n\nRod Taylor got Yvette Mimieux with that very time machine.\n\nIn <i>Back to the Future</i>,\n\nMarty McFly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother.\n\nThose are movies.\n\nOf course they're movies.\n\nWere you expecting me to come up with an example involving a real-life time machine?\n\nThat's absurd.\n\nCome on, guys, push!\n\nIf I push any harder, I'm going to give birth to my colon.\n\nHey, guys.\n\nHi, Penny.\n\nTake a break, guys!\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\nYou know, just moving a time machine.\n\nNeat, but I really gotta get to work.\n\nNo problem.\n\nHang on.\n\nBut... what about your time machine?\n\nSome things are more important than toys.\n\nI'm scared.\n\nDon't worry, baby. I've got you.\n\nIt's still my turn.\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\nI'm packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell.\n\nWas that really necessary?\n\nIf you need money, you can always sell blood.\n\nAnd semen.\n\nThis is not about money.\n\nWe brought food!\n\nLox and bagels, the breakfast of time-travelers.\n\nTerrific. Does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine?\n\nWhy?\n\nI don't want it anymore.\n\nWhy?\n\nJust... personal reasons.\n\nMy Spidey sense tells me this has something to do with Penny.\n\nLook, do you want to buy me out or not?\n\nI'll give you $100, which will make me half-owner and we'll put it on my balcony.\n\nScrew his balcony. I'll give you $120 and we'll put it in my garage.\n\nI paid $200 for my share.\n\nDude, everybody knows a time machine loses half its value the minute you drive it off the lot.\n\nI'll go for $200. That time machine stays right where it is. $300 and I'll throw in my original with real light speed sound effects.\n\nNo. No more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or Darth Vader voice changers.\n\nI'm getting rid of all of it.\n\nYou can't do that.

You've already got Penny!\n\nHow do I have Penny?\n\nIn what universe do I have Penny?\n\nSo I can have Penny?\n\nHell, no!\n\nExcuse me.\n\nCan I interject something?\n\nI'm ordering pizza online.\n\nIs everyone okay with pepperoni?\n\nSheldon, can I talk to you in private?\n\nI guess.\n\nDon't worry. I was going to order you cheese-less.\n\nThank you.\n\nIt's okay.\n\nLactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about.\n\nI'm a fancy Indian man.\n\nWe invented pajamas.\n\nHey, look at me.\n\nI don't have a foreskin.\n\nAre you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman?\n\nShe certainly has the symmetry and low body fat that Western culture deems desirable.\n\nIt's noteworthy, at other points in history, heavier women were the standard for beauty because their girth suggested affluence.\n\nThat's fascinating...\n\nI didn't say it was fascinating.\n\nI said it was noteworthy.\n\nAll right... noted.\n\nBut my point is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz, they're hitting on your sister.\n\nOkay.\n\nYou know, I don't want to criticize your rhetorical style, but we'd be a lot further along in this conversation if you'd begun with that thought.\n\nGreat...\n\nI'm saying we took quite an unnecessary detour from what I now understand to be your thesis.\n\nWhatever.\n\nYou have to do something about it.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause she's your sister.\n\nI don't understand.\n\nYes, we shared a uterus for nine months, but since then we've pretty much gone our own separate ways.\n\nOkay, consider this.\n\nWith your father gone, it is your responsibility to make sure that Missy chooses a suitable mate.\n\nI hadn't considered that.\n\nWe do share DNA.\n\nSo there is the possibility, however remote, that resting in her loins is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself.\n\nExactly.\n\nAnd you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sister's future offspring.\n\nYou're right.\n\nIf someone wants to get at Missy's Fallopian tubes, they'll have to go through me.\n\nI am Shiva the Destroyer!\n\nI will have the woman.\n\nI'm warning you,\n\nI was judo champion at math camp.\n\nAll right, now that's enough juvenile squabbling.\n\nYou stop it. Stop it, I say!\n\nI'm going to settle this right now.\n\nNeither of you are good enough for my sister.\n\nWho are you to decide that?\n\nHe's the man of his family.\n\nYou have to respect his wishes.\n\nYou're out, too, by the way.\n\nSay what?\n\nIt's nothing personal. I'd just prefer if my future niece or nephew didn't become flatulent every time they ate an eskimo pie.\n\nWhat are you so happy about?\n\nI'm not happy.\n\nIt's the medication.\n\nI can't stop smiling.\n\nNow that Leonard's made me aware how high the genetic stakes are... we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister.\n\nWait a minute.\n\nLeonard made you aware of that?\n\nWe all make mistakes.\n\nLet's move on.\n\nExcuse me, I think you're missing a big opportunity here.\n\nHow so?\n\nEverybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring.\n\nWhy not put a little mocha in the family latte?\n\nIn principle, you have a point.\n\nBut as a practical matter, need I remind you that it takes experimental pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex.\n\nI think you're focusing entirely too much on the drugs.\n\nIs it 'cause I'm Jewish? 'Cause I'd kill my rabbi with a pork chop to be with your sister.\n\nThis has nothing to do with religion.\n\nThis has to do with the fact that you're a tiny, tiny man who still lives with his mother.\n\nSheldon, you are really being unreasonable.\n\nAm I?\n\nHere, eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister.\n\nOh, really?\n\nShelly, can I speak to you for a minute?\n\nAlone.\n\nWhy does everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone?\n\nUsually nobody wants to be alone with me.\n\nWe all make mistakes.\n\nLet's move on.\n\nI'm not even going to ask why you're pimping me out for cheese.\n\nBut since when do you care at all about who I sleep with?\n\nTruthfully, I've never given it any thought, but it has been pointed out to me that you carry DNA of great potential.\n\nWhat on earth are you talking about?\n\nLet me explain.\n\nYou see,\n\nI'm a superior genetic mutation, an improvement on the existing mediocre stock.\n\nAnd what do you mean, \"mediocre stock\"?\n\nThat would be you.\n\nBut residing within you, is the potential for another me.\n\nPerhaps even taller, smarter, and less prone to freckling, a Sheldon 2.0, if you will. \"Sheldon 2.0\"?\n\nExactly.\n\nNow, I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with.\n\nIf you're not attracted to the suitor, the likelihood of conception will be reduced.\n\nYou have got to be kidding me.\n\nNot at all.\n\nFrequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertilization.\n\nOkay, Shelly, sit down.\n\nNow I've lived my whole life dealing with the fact that my twin brother is, as mom puts it, \"one of God's special, little people\".\n\nI always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird.\n\nYou know, a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds.\n\nOf course, the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food, leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death.\n\nLuckily for you, that's where the metaphor ended.\n\nI thought it ended at \"cuckoo\".\n\nYou listen to me.\n\nIf you want to start acting like a brother who cares about me, then terrific. Bring it on.\n\nBut you try one time to tell me who I should be sleeping with, and you and I are going to go round and round the way we did when we were little.\n\nRemember?\n\nI have an alternate proposal.\n\nGo on.\n\nYou donate eggs.\n\nWe will place them in cryogenic storage.\n\nI will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs, have them fertilized and implanted in you.\n\nThat way, everybody wins.\n\nCorrection.\n\nMissy can date whoever she wants.\n\nLook, we have to settle this.\n\nI agree.\n\nSheldon's sister is hiding at Penny's because we've all been hitting on her at the same time.\n\nShe's not hiding.\n\nShe needed privacy to call her grandmother who's apparently very sick.\n\nAnd then I believe she has to wash her hair.\n\nYou poor, deluded bastard.\n\nDon't start with me.\n\nYou want to go again? Let's go.\n\nSit down.\n\nIf we're going to fight over Missy, let's do it the right way.\n\nThe honorable way.\n\nTake that!\n\nYou want some more?\n\nAnd he's down!\n\nOne, two, three...\n\nCome on! Get up!\n\nStay down, bitch!\n\nNine, ten.\n\nNatural selection at work.\n\nI weep for humanity.\n\nExcuse me while I go tell\n\nMissy the good news.\n\nLeonard.\n\nHi, Penny. How's it going?\n\nThat guy Mike that you were dating, is that still going on?\n\nPretty much. Why?\n\nNothing, just catching up. By the way, may I speak to Missy, please?\n\nOf course.\n\nHi, Leonard. What's up?\n\nSince you're leaving tomorrow,\n\nI was wondering if you'd like to go to dinner with me.\n\nThat's so sweet. But no thanks.\n\nDo you have other plans or...\n\nNo.\n\nAll right.\n\nEnjoy the rest of your evening.\n\nThanks. See ya.\n\nHere's something we didn't anticipate.\n\nWhat do you want, Howard?\n\nI'm fine. Thanks for asking.\n\nI've come to call on Missy.\n\nHi, Howard.\n\nThe Amazing Howard.\n\nDo you like magic?\n\nNot really. No.\n\nThen you are in for a treat.\n\nBehold, an ordinary cane.\n\nThank you. I apprec...\n\nApprec...\n\nAppree...\n\nOh, honey.\n\nIs your medication wearing off?\n\nWell, hi, cutie pie.\n\nI was hoping you'd show up.\n\nWe had a dog who made a noise like that.\n\nHad to put him down.\n\nAny news you want me to pass on to Mom?\n\nWell, she might be interested to know that I have refocused my research from bosonic string theory to heterotic string theory.\n\nI'll just tell her you say \"hey\".\n\nWell, it was pleasant seeing you, other than that business with my testicles.\n\nCome on, Shelly.\n\nI want you to know\n\nI'm very proud of you.\n\nReally?\n\nYep, I'm always bragging to my friends about my brother, the rocket scientist.\n\nYou tell people I'm a rocket scientist?\n\nWell, yeah.\n\nI'm a theoretical physicist.\n\nWhat's the difference?\n\nWhat's the difference?\n\nGood bye, Shelly.\n\nMy God!\n\nWhy don't you just tell them that I'm a toll-taker at the Golden Gate Bridge?\n\nRocket scientist.

Typical Taurus.\n\nAre we gonna see you Saturday?\n\nI don't think so.\n\nWhy not?\n\nI don't celebrate my birthday.\n\nShut up. Yeah, you do.\n\nIt's no big deal; it's just the way I was raised.\n\nMy parents focused on celebrating achievements, and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them.\n\nThat's so silly.\n\nIt's actually based on very sound theories.\n\nHis mother published a paper on it.\n\nWhat was it called? \"I Hate My Son and That's Why He Can't Have Cake\"?\n\nIt was obviously effective.\n\nLeonard grew up to be an experimental physicist.\n\nPerhaps if she'd also denied him\n\nChristmas, he'd be a little better at it.\n\nThank you.\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nWell, I love birthdays.\n\nWaking up to Mom's special\n\nFrench toast breakfast, wearing the birthday king crown, playing laser tag with all my friends...\n\nYeah, see?\n\nThat's what kids should have.\n\nActually, that was last year.\n\nSo you really never had a birthday party?\n\nNo, but it was okay.\n\nWhen I was little, I'd think maybe my parents would change their mind and surprise me with a party.\n\nLike this one birthday\n\nI came home from my cello lesson and I saw a lot of strange cars parked out front.\n\nWhen I got to the door,\n\nI could hear people whispering and I could smell German chocolate cake, which is my favorite.\n\nAnd?\n\nIt turns out my grandfather had died.\n\nOh, my God. That's terrible.\n\nWell, it was kind of like a birthday party.\n\nI got to see all my cousins, and there was cake, so...\n\nIt's the saddest thing I've ever heard.\n\nYou think?\n\nGo ahead, tell her about your senior prom.\n\nEpisode 16:\n\nThe Peanut Reaction\n\nMake sure they remember, no peanuts.\n\nHoward, every Thai restaurant in town knows you can't eat peanuts.\n\nWhen they see me coming, they go, \"Ah, no-peanut boy!\"\n\nHello, Penny. Leonard just left.\n\nI know. I want to talk to you.\n\nWhat would we talk about?\n\nWe have no overlapping areas of interest I'm aware of.\n\nAs you know, I don't care for chitchat.\n\nCan you just let me in?\n\nAll right, but I don't see this as a promising endeavor.\n\nHere's the deal. We're gonna throw\n\nLeonard a kick-ass surprise party for his birthday on Saturday.\n\nI hardly think so.\n\nLeonard made it very clear he doesn't want a party.\n\nDid someone say... \"party\"?\n\nHe just doesn't know he wants one 'cause he's never had one.\n\nI suppose that's possible, but for the record,\n\nI've never had a threesome and yet I still know I want one.\n\nHoward, here's the difference...\n\nThe possibility exists that Leonard could have a birthday party before hell freezes over.\n\nFine. If I do have a threesome, you can't be part of it.\n\nI'm just kidding. Yes, you can.\n\nCan you bring a friend?\n\nI think a birthday party's a terrible idea.\n\nI envy Leonard for growing up without that anguish.\n\nAnguish?!\n\nYear after year, I had to endure wearing comical hats while being forced into the crowded, sweaty hell of bouncy castles.\n\nNot to mention being blindfolded and spun toward a grotesque tailless donkey as the other children mocked my disorientation.\n\nOkay, sweetie, I understand you have scars that no nonprofessional can heal, but, nevertheless, we're going to throw Leonard a birthday party.\n\nHave I pointed out that I'm extremely uncomfortable with dancing, loud music and most other forms of alcohol-induced frivolity?\n\nNevertheless...\n\nIn addition, I...\n\nHere's the deal:\n\nYou either help me throw a birthday party or I will go into your bedroom and unbag all of your most valuable mint-condition comic books.\n\nAnd on one of them, you won't know which,\n\nI'll draw a tiny happy face in ink.\n\nYou can't do that. If you make a mark in a mint comic, it's no longer mint.\n\nDo you understand the concept of blackmail?\n\nWell, of course, I...\n\nI have an idea. Let's throw Leonard a kick-ass birthday party.\n\nThat's not the secret knock.\n\nThis is the secret knock.\n\nWhat difference does it make?\n\nThe whole point of a secret knock is to establish a non-verbal signal to verify the identity of one's co-conspirators.\n\nIs that Raj and Howard?\n\nPossibly, but unverified.\n\nWill you just let us in.\n\nLuckily for you, this is not a nuclear reactor.\n\nSo what'd you get the birthday boy?\n\nWell, Raj got him an awesome, limited edition Dark Knight sculpture based on Alex Ross's definitive Batman.\n\nAnd I got him this amazing autographed copy of <i>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</i>.\n\nNice.\n\nI got him a sweater.\n\nOkay, well, he might like that.\n\nI've seen him get chilly.\n\nSheldon, I didn't see your present.\n\nThat's because I didn't bring one.\n\nWhy not?\n\nDon't ask.\n\nThe entire institution of gift-giving makes no sense.\n\nToo late.\n\nLet's say I go out and I spend $50 on you.\n\nIt's a laborious activity because I have to imagine what you need, whereas you know what you need.\n\nNow, I could simplify things... just give you the $50 directly, and then you could give me $50 on my birthday, and so on, until one of us dies, leaving the other one old and $50 richer.\n\nAnd I ask you, is it worth it?\n\nTold you not to ask.\n\nSheldon, you're his friend.\n\nFriends give each other presents.\n\nI accept your premise;\n\nI reject your conclusion.\n\nTry telling him it's a non-optional social convention.\n\nWhat?\n\nJust do it.\n\nIt's a non-optional... social convention.\n\nOh. Fair enough.\n\nHe came with a manual.\n\nQuestion. How am I going to get Leonard a present before the party?\n\nI don't drive and the only things available within walking distance are a Thai restaurant and a gas station.\n\nI suppose I could wrap up an order of mee krob and a couple of lottery scratchers.\n\nOkay let's do this...\n\nI will drive Sheldon to get a present.\n\nHoward, you need to get rid of Leonard for about 2 hours.\n\nNo problem.\n\nAnd then, Raj, you bring the stuff across the hall and start setting up.\n\nWhat if guests show up?\n\nEntertain them.\n\nWhat if they're women?\n\nStare at them and make them feel uncomfortable.\n\nHow's it goin'?\n\nFine.\n\nSo listen, the NuArt is showing the revised, definitive cut of <i>Blade Runner</i>.\n\nSeen it.\n\nNo, you've seen the 25th Anniversary Final Cut.\n\nThis one has eight seconds of previously unseen footage.\n\nThey say it completely changes the tone of the film.\n\nPass.\n\nCome on. Afterwards, there's a Q & A with Harrison Ford's body double.\n\nLook, I'm in the Halo battle of my life here.\n\nThere's this kid in Copenhagen... he has no immune system, so all he does is sit in his bubble and play Halo 24-seven.\n\nCan't you play him some other time?\n\nNot if you believe his doctors.\n\nOh, my God, do you smell gas?\n\nNo.\n\nYeah, no.\n\nThey have DVDs over there.\n\nYes, but they have\n\nDVD burners over here.\n\nLeonard needs a DVD burner.\n\nA gift shouldn't be something someone needs, it should be something fun.\n\nSomething they wouldn't buy for themself.\n\nYou mean like a sweater?\n\nIt's a fun sweater.\n\nIt's got a bold geometric print.\n\nIs it the geometry that makes it fun?\n\nThe point is one of the ways we show we care about people is by putting thought and imagination into the gifts we give them.\n\nOkay, I see. So, not a DVD burner.\n\nExactly.\n\nSomething he wouldn't buy for himself, something fun,\n\nSomething like...\n\nAn 802-11n wireless router!\n\nHere you go, Copenhagen boy.\n\nHow about a taste of Hans Christian hand grenade?\n\nThat could not feel good.\n\nCome on, come... Oh, you clever...\n\nCome on.\n\nTake that!\n\nWhat's the matter?\n\nThis granola bar has peanuts in it!\n\nOh, my God. Why did you eat it?\n\nI don't know. It was just there!\n\nIf I had a gun there, would you have shot yourself?\n\nDon't yell at me!\n\nI've got to go to the emergency room!\n\nNow?!\n\nNo, after my tongue has swollen to the size of a brisket!\n\nAll right, just let me get my keys.\n\nOh, God, oh, God, oh, God!\n\nThe laundry is out of the hamper.\n\nOkay, Sheldon, what was it supposed to be?\n\nFine. It's out of the washer!\n\nI'll call you when it's in the dryer.\n\nAll right, let's go.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nThat one.\n\nBecause of the two additional Ethernet ports?\n\nSure.\n\nNo need, he's already got a six-port Ethernet switch.\n\nOkay, then this one.\n\nWhy?\n\nI don't know.\n\nThe man on the box looks so happy.\n\nPenny, if I'm going to buy Leonard a gift, I'm going to do it right.\n\nI refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma I did.\n\nI know I'm gonna regret this, but: What trauma?\n\nOn my 12th birthday,\n\nI really wanted a titanium centrifuge so, you know,\n\nI could separate radioactive isotopes.\n\nOf course.\n\nInstead of a titanium centrifuge, my parents bought me...\n\nThis is hard.\n\nThey got me a motorized dirt bike.\n\nWhat 12-year-old boy wants a motorized dirt bike?\n\nAll of them?\n\nReally?\n\nYeah.\n\nSo we're getting this one?\n\nYeah, I suppose.\n\nAll right, let's go.\n\nExcuse me.\n\nDo you know anything about this stuff?\n\nI know everything about this stuff.\n\nOkay, I have my own wholesale flower business and I want to hook up my computer in the front entrance with the one in my refrigerated warehouse.\n\nBuy this one: it's the one we're getting. Happy guy.\n\nNo, she doesn't want that.\n\nShe needs a point-to-point peer network with a range extender.\n\nThank you.\n\nWhich hard drive do I want... firewire or USB?\n\nIt depends on what buss you have available.\n\nI drive a Chevy Cavalier.\n\nOh, dear Lord.\n\nWe have to go.\n\nNot now.\n\nThis poor man needs me.\n\nYou, hold on. I'll be right with you.\n\nWhat computer do you have?\n\nAnd please don't say \"a white one.\"\n\nExcuse me.\n\nFill this out. Have a seat.\n\nListen. We're throwing my friend a surprise party\n\nI'm supposed to keep him out of his apartment for 2 hours.\n\nFill this out and have a seat.\n\nNo, the only way I could get him to leave was to tell him I ate a peanut because I'm allergic to peanuts.\n\nWell, in that case, fill this out and have a seat.\n\nAll I need from you is to take me in the back and give me a Band-Aid so I can pretend I had a shot of epinephrine, and you tell my friend you need to keep me under observation for 1 hour 1/2.\n\nIs that all you need?\n\nYes.\n\nGet out of my ER.\n\nNo, you don't understand.\n\nI understand, but unfortunately, this hospital is not equipped to treat stupid.\n\nOkay, I get it.\n\nI know how the world works.\n\nHow about if I were to introduce to you to the man who freed your people?\n\nUnless my people were freed by Benjamin Franklin and his five twin brothers, you are wasting your time.\n\nSorry, I couldn't find a parking spot.\n\nHow are you doing?\n\nBad, very bad.\n\nReally? You don't look like you're swelling up at all.\n\nWe should just pick up some Benadryl at the drugstore and go home.\n\nWe can't go home.\n\nWhy not?\n\nBecause... because...\n\nBrisket! Brisket!\n\nWater! Need water!\n\nI'll be right back.\n\nI've got a problem.\n\nWell, so do I.\n\nYou gotta stall Leonard a little longer.\n\nI don't think I can.\n\nYou have to.\n\nWe all have to be there at the same time to yell surprise.\n\nYou have to understand something.\n\nWe're in a hospital right now.\n\nWhy? Is Leonard okay?\n\nLeonard's fine. I'm fine.\n\nThanks for asking, by the way.\n\nOkay, I don't need your attitude.\n\nJust hold him there a little longer.\n\nI've done my best, but he wants to go home and I don't know how to stop him.\n\nOkay, how about this?\n\nYou keep him there a little longer, and when you get to the party, I'll point out which of my friends are easy?\n\nDon't toy with me, woman.\n\nI got a hot former fat girl with no self-esteem, a girl who punishes her father by sleeping around a alcoholic who's 2 tequila shots away from letting you wear her like a hat.\n\nThy will be done.\n\nI'm doing this for you, little buddy.\n\nOkay, we don't have that in stock... but I can special-order it for you.\n\nHim.\n\nExcuse me, sir.\n\nYou don't work here.\n\nYes, well, apparently, neither does anyone else.\n\nSheldon, we have to go.\n\nWhy?\n\nFor one thing, we're late for\n\nLeonard's birthday party, and for another,\n\nI told him to call security.\n\nGood luck.\n\nBy the way, a six-year-old could hack your computer system.\n\nKeep walking. \"1234\" is not a secure password.\n\nExcuse me, my friend is having an allergic reaction to peanuts.\n\nNo, he's not.\n\nYes, he is.\n\nLook, sir, we are very busy here, and I...\n\nHoly crap!\n\nPlease help me!\n\nCode four! I need a gurney!\n\nRight away! Right away!\n\nThank you.\n\nSay what you will about the healthcare system in this country, but when they're afraid of lawsuits, they sure test everything.\n\nI really don't think the colonoscopy was necessary.\n\nYou know, before you got all swollen up,\n\nI actually thought you were trying to keep me out of the apartment so you could throw me a surprise party.\n\nRight, it's your birthday.\n\nI had no idea it was your birthday.\n\nI completely forgot.\n\nWhat a lousy way to spend a birthday.\n\nIt's all over now.\n\nThere is a party, isn't there?\n\nMaybe.\n\nAre you mad?\n\nHow could I be mad?\n\nYou actually risked your life because you care about me.\n\nYeah, that's why I did it.\n\nAll right.\n\nHere we go.\n\nMy first birthday party.\n\nDude, everybody left an hour ago.\n\nSurprise!\n\nOkay, Leonard.\n\nI am at your birthday party.\n\nI don't know where you are, dude, but it's really kick-ass!\n\nEveryone is very, very drunk and...\n\nAnd look, there's a girl taking her shirt off!\n\nThat's my friend Carol.\n\nRemind me,\n\nI gotta introduce her to Howard.\n\nOh, sweet Krishna, shake that rupee maker!\n\nI'm so sorry you didn't get your party.\n\nIt's okay.\n\nHappy birthday, anyways.\n\nWhen's your birthday?\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "6171ca93-b8bb-4705-87b2-3752c1257a3c": {"__data__": {"id_": "6171ca93-b8bb-4705-87b2-3752c1257a3c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "0da5e61c75ae789cadfec8b6900777a5dadcef48754f7a2a542b0f00ff4cef28", "text": "\n\nNon, c'est...\n\nWhat's this?\n\nThat's what you did.\n\nI assumed, as in a number of languages, that the gesture was part of the phrase.\n\nWell, it's not.\n\nHow am I supposed to know that?\n\nAs the teacher, it's your obligation to separate your personal idiosyncrasies from the subject matter.\n\nYou know, I'm really glad you decided to learn Mandarin.\n\nWhy?\n\nOnce you're fluent, you'll have a billion more people to annoy instead of me.\n\nYou just called Leonard a syphilitic donkey.\n\nMy apologies,\n\nI'm only as good as my teacher.\n\nWhy are you learning Chinese?\n\nI believe the Szechuan Palace has been passing off orange chicken as tangerine chicken and I intend to confront them.\n\nIf I were you, I'd be more concerned about what they are passing off as chicken.\n\nI need to use your window.\n\nSure, go ahead.\n\nHey, jerk face, you forgot your iPod!\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nI'll tell you what's going on.\n\nThat stupid self-centered bastar wrote about our sex life in his blog.\n\nDrop dead, you stupid self-centered bastard!\n\nThank you.\n\nOkay, where were we?\n\nNot now, I have a blog to find.\n\nEpisode 117: The Tangerine Factor\n\nPenny, are you okay?\n\nI'm fine, Leonard. Just go away!\n\nI understand that breaking up with someone can be very painful...\n\nGo away!\n\nOkay, feel better! Bye!\n\nShe doesn't want to talk.\n\nNot surprising.\n\nPenny's emotional response is originated in the primitive portion of the brain, known as the amygdala.\n\nWhile speech is centered in the much more recently developed neo-cortex.\n\nThe former can easily overpower the latter, giving scientific credence to the notion of being \"rendered speechless.\"\n\nOr maybe she just doesn't want to talk.\n\nLook, I found an iPod!\n\nIt's smashed beyond repair.\n\nWhat are you gonna do with it?\n\nWhat else?\n\nSell it on eBay as \"slightly used.\"\n\nIt was Penny's boyfriend's, they broke up.\n\nApparently, he posted intimate details of their physical relationship on his blog which I cannot find anywhere.\n\nI'm gonna go back and try talking to her again.\n\nGood idea, sit with her.\n\nHold her, comfort her.\n\nAnd if the moment feels right, see if you can cop a feel.\n\nI'm not going to do that, Howard.\n\nI'm not aware of a new social convention that requires you to intervene at all.\n\nWhat about damsel in distress?\n\nTwelfth century code of chivalry?\n\nNot exactly current.\n\nYou'd also have to be knighted for that to apply.\n\nI don't care.\n\nShe's upset, I'm going over there.\n\nRemember to sit on your hands a bit, so they're warm.\n\nI'm her friend. I'm not going to take advantage of her vulnerability.\n\nSo you're saying, if in the depths of despair, she throws herself at you and demands you take her, right there, right now, you'll just walk away?\n\nI said I'm her friend, not her gay friend.\n\nListen, I know you said you didn't want to talk...\n\nI don't.\n\nSorry.\n\nWait!\n\nWait? Did you say \"wait\"?\n\nTell me the truth.\n\nAm I just an idiot who picks giant losers?\n\nSo I pick good guys but turn them into losers.\n\nOf course not.\n\nWell, it's gotta be one or the other.\n\nWhich is it?\n\nI'm sorry, what were the choices again?\n\nI really thought Mike was different.\n\nI thought he was... sensitive and smart,\n\nI mean, not <i>you</i> smart, normal non-freaky smart.\n\nYeah, no, sure.\n\nAnd then he just goes and has to humiliate me by writing about me on his blog so the entire world can read it.\n\nI tell you, it's not all that easy to find.\n\nReally? My friends at work found it, my sister found it.\n\nJudging by my email, a number of prisoners at the Michigan State\n\nPenitentiary found it.\n\nWhat exactly did this guy write?\n\nNot that I need to know the details of your sex life. I just thought...\n\nNever mind.\n\nNo, you know what?\n\nYou might as well read it.\n\nEverybody else has. Go ahead.\n\nOh, God, I just feel so betrayed and embarrassed!\n\nI just want to crawl into a hole and die!\n\nOkay. Well, you know, this isn't that bad.\n\nIt just paints the picture of a very affectionate woman, who's open to expressing her affection in non-traditional locales.\n\nOh, God!\n\nElevators, parks, movie theaters.\n\nOut of curiosity, is this \"subway\" the transportation system or Subway the sandwich shop?\n\nSandwich shop.\n\nDoesn't that violate the health code?\n\nNo, at the sub shop we were only making out.\n\nBut my point is that you have absolutely no reason to be embarrassed.\n\nReally?\n\nDo you think I overreacted?\n\nMaybe a little.\n\nBecause I do that. I do overreact.\n\nMaybe I should call Mike and apologize.\n\nThat would be under-reacting.\n\nHe did break the implied confidentiality of the bedroom.\n\nAnd in your case, the elevator, parks and fast food franchise.\n\nYou're right.\n\nI should just say \"I am done with him.\"\n\nYes, you should.\n\nGo ahead, say it.\n\nBut I never gave the man a chance to explain.\n\nWhat is there to explain?\n\nIt's all right here.\n\nThe betrayal!\n\nNo, you were right the first time.\n\nThis is a man who loves me, but in his own stupid way, which is trying to show people how he feels.\n\nI'm pretty sure I never said that.\n\nYou did better than that.\n\nYou helped me see it on my own.\n\nOh, good for me.\n\nWhere are you going?\n\nI'm going over to Mike's.\n\nLeonard, thank you so much.\n\nOh, sure.\n\nMaybe I <i>am</i> her gay friend.\n\nI'm going to need another Mandarin lesson.\n\nI obviously didn't make my point with those people.\n\nFor God's sake, if you don't like the tangerine chicken, don't order the tangerine chicken.\n\nI like tangerine chicken,\n\nI'm just not getting tangerine chicken.\n\nCan we please change the subject?\n\nSure.\n\nTell us again how you screwed up and got\n\nPenny back together with her boyfriend.\n\nJust roll the dice. \"Enslaved by warlocks. Stay here until you roll two, four or six.\"\n\nShe was mad at him!\n\nShe was done with him! The relationship was broken beyond repair, and I walked over there, and I fixed it.\n\nBoy, that story gets better every time you hear it.\n\nActually, I thought the first two renditions were far more compelling.\n\nPreviously, I felt sympathy for the Leonard character, now I just find him to be whiny and annoying.\n\nEat your tangerine chicken.\n\nI'd love to, but I don't have tangerine chicken.\n\nThank you so much for your stupid advice!\n\nIncredible.\n\nYou managed to screw up the screw-up.\n\nI'm back.\n\nI'm sorry I yelled at you.\n\nIt's not your fault.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nI went over to Mike's to make up with him.\n\nYeah. No, I know that part.\n\nBut he had already moved on.\n\nAlready? That was quick.\n\nThat's what I said to the woman who had her legs around his neck.\n\nPenny, I am so sorry.\n\nHow could he do that?!\n\nYou know, you did throw an 80-gig iPod...\n\nYeah, no, how could he do that?\n\nI swear to God I am done with guys like that.\n\nYou know, macho with the perfect body and the hair and the money.\n\nYeah, that must get old quick.\n\nYou know, just once\n\nI would like to go out with someone who is nice and honest and who actually cares about me.\n\nWhat about me?\n\nWhat about you what?\n\nWhat about if you went out with me?\n\nAre you asking me out?\n\nYes, I am... asking you out.\n\nI was just going off your comment about the nice guy.\n\nNo, I got that.\n\nAnd honest.\n\nTotally.\n\nIt's not a big deal.\n\nYes what?\n\nYes, I will go out with you.\n\nReally?\n\nWhy not? I mean...\n\nWhat do I have to lose?\n\nThat's the spirit.\n\nShow me your citrus peels.\n\nShow me your citrus peels.\n\nSheldon?\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nLook, do you have a second?\n\nA second what, pair of underwear?\n\nI was just wondering if I could talk to you. It's about Leonard.\n\nWhy me?\n\nWhy not Koothrappali or Wolowitz?\n\nWell, Raj can't talk to me unless he's drunk, and Wolowitz is, you know, disgusting.\n\nYes, I suppose he is.\n\nAll I'm saying is, you know Leonard the best.\n\nNot necessarily.\n\nI'm often surprised by my lack of familiarity with Leonard.\n\nJust the other day I discovered he not only has a loofah, he hides it.\n\nWhy do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah?\n\nI, myself, prefer to have my excess epithelial cells slough off naturally, but I don't condemn those who seek to accelerate the process.\n\nAnd until recently,\n\nI had no idea that despite his lactose intolerance, he can tolerate small amounts of non-fat ice cream without producing a noxious gas that I maintain, in the right concentration, could be weaponized.\n\nLeonard might come home.\n\nCan we talk in my apartment?\n\nWe're not done?\n\nNo.\n\nWhy not? We're already through the looking glass anyway.\n\nOkay, so here's the thing...\n\nI guess you're aware that Leonard asked me out.\n\nHe didn't actually say anything, but when he came back to the apartment he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in <i>Fantasia</i>.\n\nThat's nice.\n\nAnyhow, the thing I wanted to talk to you about is, since Leonard and I have become friends... I was just...\n\nWanna sit down?\n\nI wish it were that simple.\n\nI don't spend much time here, and so\n\nI've never really chosena place to sit.\n\nWell, choose.\n\nThere are a number of options and...\n\nI'm really not familiar enough with the cushion densities, air flow patterns and dispersion of unlight to make an informed choice.\n\nWhy don't you just pick one at random and if you don't like it you can sit somewhere else next time.\n\nNo. That's crazy.\n\nYou go ahead and talk while I figure it out.\n\nHere's the thing.\n\nSo I've known for a while now that Leonard has had a little crush on me...\n\nA little crush?\n\nI suppose so... in the same way Menelaus had a \"little crush\" on Helen of Troy.\n\nI don't really know who they are...\n\nMenelaus was the brother of Agamemnon.\n\nI don't care.\n\nThe point is,\n\nLeonard isn't the kind of guy\n\nI usually go out with.\n\nLeonard isn't the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with.\n\nWould you be open to rotating the couch clockwise 30 degrees?\n\nNo. What I'm saying is\n\nLeonard might be different in a good way.\n\nObviously, my usual choices have not worked out so well.\n\nYour last one worked out well for Koothrappali.\n\nHe got a free iPod.\n\nGlare.\n\nOn the other hand, if things don't go well with Leonard,\n\nI risk losing a really good friend.\n\nI'm guessing he's not looking for a fling.\n\nHe's the kind of guy that gets into a relationship for... like you would say, light years.\n\nI would not say that.\n\nNo one would say that. A light year is a unit of distance not time.\n\nThank you for the clarification.\n\nDraft.\n\nPeople hear the word \"year\" and they think duration. \"Foot-pound\" has the same problem, that's a unit of work, not of weight.\n\nRight. Thanks.\n\nIt's a common mistake.\n\nNot the first one I've made today.\n\nI think this will be my seat.\n\nDo you have anything to say that has anything to do with what I'm talking about?\n\nWell, let's see...\n\nWe might consider Schrodinger's cat.\n\nSchrodinger?\n\nIs that the woman in 2A?\n\nThat's Mrs. Grossinger.\n\nShe doesn't have a cat, she has a Mexican hairless.\n\nAnnoying little animal.\n\nSheldon.\n\nSorry, you diverted me.\n\nAnyway, in 1935, Erwin Schrodinger, in an attempt to explain the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, he proposed an experiment where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison that will break open at a random time.\n\nNow, since no one knows when or if the poison has been released, until the box is opened, the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead.\n\nSorry. I don't get the point.\n\nOf course you don't get it.\n\nI haven't made it yet.\n\nYou'd have to be psychic to get it, and there's no such thing as \"psychic.\"\n\nSheldon, what's the point?!\n\nJust like Schrodinger's cat, your potential relationship with Leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad.\n\nIt is only by opening the box that you'll find out which it is.\n\nOkay, so you're saying I should go out with Leonard.\n\nLet me start again.\n\nIn 1935, Erwin Schrodinger...\n\nTwo seats right there.\n\nSheldon, I think I've made a mistake.\n\nI can see that.\n\nUnless you're planning on running a marathon, choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes is a starch-filled redundancy.\n\nNo, it's about Penny.\n\nA mistake involving Penny.\n\nYou'll have to narrow it down.\n\nI don't think\n\nI can go out with her tonight.\n\nThen don't.\n\nOther people would say \"Why not?\"\n\nOther people might be interested.\n\nI'm going to talk anyway.\n\nI assumed you would.\n\nNow that I'm actually about to go out with Penny,\n\nI'm not excited, I'm nauseous.\n\nThen your meal choice is appropriate.\n\nStarch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion.\n\nRight.\n\nYou also made a common grammatical mistake.\n\nYou said \"nauseous,\" when you meant \"nauseated.\"\n\nBut go on.\n\nSheldon, this date is probably my one chance with Penny.\n\nWhat happens if I blow it?\n\nWell, if we accept your premise and also accept the highly improbable assumption that Penny is the only woman in the world for you, then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely, bitter old man with no progeny.\n\nThe image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers from Scooby-Doo cartoons comes to mind.\n\nYou're not helping.\n\nWhat response on my part would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion?\n\nTell me whether or not to go through with the date.\n\nSchrodinger's cat.\n\nThat's brilliant.\n\nYou sound surprised.\n\nCome on in.\n\nThank you.\n\nYou look very nice.\n\nThank you. So do you.\n\nI made an 8:00 reservation.\n\nOkay, yeah, great.

Continue.\n\nGenetic weakness, right.\n\nThere's the lactose intolerance.\n\nDon't forget the male-pattern baldness.\n\nWhen his uncles sit around the dinner table, they look like a half carton of eggs.\n\nOkay, my uncles are bald, but my Aunt Edna is one of the hairiest women you'll ever meet.\n\nSweet lady.\n\nAlways tickles when she hugs me.\n\nWhat now?\n\nI have to make pee-pee.\n\nI'm sorry about all of Sheldon's interruptions.\n\nHe can be a bit of an eccentric.\n\nIf by \"eccentric\" you mean passive-aggressive\n\nEast Texas blowhole, I agree.\n\nI think tonight was a very good start.\n\nMe, too.\n\nYou sure you're okay postponing intercourse until our relationship is past the initial viability test?\n\nNo problem, I'm very skilled at postponing intercourse.\n\nI guess I'll call you and we'll arrange another evening.\n\nI believe protocol dictates you wait a minimum of 18 hours before you call so I'm not repulsed by your cloying eagerness.\n\nSure.\n\nAgain, it's your decision.\n\nYou're the man.\n\nIt wasn't my cat.\n\nIt was an experiment designed by this guy named Schroedinger.\n\nFrom the Charlie Brown cartoons?\n\nNo, he was some kind of scientist.\n\nLet me start again.\n\nHey, Leonard.\n\nHello.\n\nLeslie.\n\nHi.\n\nOkay, well... good night.\n\nOkay, good night.\n\nThat ain't gonna make your point.\n\nThat's enough.\n\nCall me.\n\nRight.\n\nOkay, good night.\n\nWhat?\n\nHad a great time. Ciao.\n\nI'm sorry, I am not going back to the Renaissance fair.\n\nCome on, there's so few places\n\nI can wear my jester costume.\n\nI don't care.\n\nThere are far too many historical anomalies for my comfort.\n\nOkay, how about this?\n\nYou can go dressed as a Star Trek science officer exploring a planet similar to Earth in the 1500s.\n\nYou mean, like Spock?\n\nSure.\n\nFascinating.\n\nHey, fellow scientists...\n\nWhy don't we all move over there so Leslie can join us?\n\nLet's do it.\n\nIf you're having trouble deciding where to sit, may I suggest one potato, two potato?\n\nOr as I call it, \"the Leslie Winkle experimental methodology.\"\n\nDon't make this hard for me.\n\nIt's not hard.\n\nIt's simple.\n\nYou can either sit with me, your friend, colleague and roommate or with an overrated scientist you might have sex with.\n\nYou're right, it is simple.\n\nHey, Sheldon.\n\nPenny.\n\nThird floor tonight... mixing it up?\n\nI still don't understand why you don't go to dinner or something.\n\nAll right, let's say I go to dinner alone, and during the meal,\n\nI have to use the restroom.\n\nHow do I know someone's not touching my food?\n\nGood night, Sheldon.\n\nPenny, hold on.\n\nAre you sure things can't work out with you and Leonard?\n\nExcuse me?\n\nI'm just wondering if you really gave it the old college try.\n\nOr in your case, the old community college try.\n\nOkay, where is this coming from?\n\nLeonard is upstairs right now with my archenemy.\n\nYour archenemy?\n\nThe Dr. Doom to my Mr. Fantastic.\n\nThe Dr. Octopus to my Spider-Man, the Dr. Sivana to my Captain Marvel.\n\nI get it.\n\nIt's amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees.\n\nGraduate school should do a better job of screening those people out.\n\nSheldon, come back.\n\nYou're losing me.\n\nIt's Leslie Winkle, Penny.\n\nShe belittles my research.\n\nSweetie, I'm sorry.\n\nShe called me \"dumbass.\"\n\nI know. I heard.\n\nGiven this situation,\n\nI have no choice but to withdraw my previous objections to your ill-considered relationship with Leonard.\n\nGee, well, thank you for that.\n\nBut I think for now,\n\nLeonard and I are just gonna stay friends.\n\nNo, that response is unacceptable to me.\n\nSheldon, you are a smart guy...\n\nI'm \"smart\"?\n\nI'd have to lose 60 IQ points to be classified as \"smart.\"\n\nAre you gonna let me talk?\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nYou must know that if Leonard and Leslie want to be together, nothing you can do is gonna stop it.\n\nYou continue to underestimate my capabilities, madam.\n\nLet me put it this way.\n\nIf you're really Leonard's friend, you will support him no matter who he wants to be with.\n\nWait a minute.\n\nWhy am I doing all the giving here?\n\nIf Leonard's really my friend, why doesn't he have to support me and my hatred of Leslie Winkle?\n\nBecause love trumps hate.\n\nNow you're just making stuff up.\n\nOkay, good night, Sheldon.\n\nMario...\n\nIf only I could control everyone the way I control you.\n\nHop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop.\n\nWhen the two of you reach a natural stopping point,\n\nI'd like to have a word.\n\nIf the word is \"pee-pee,\" just do it.\n\nLeonard, you're my friend, and friends support their friends... apparently.\n\nSo I'm withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with Leslie.\n\nThank you.\n\nI will graciously overlook the fact that she is an arrogant, subpar scientist who actually believes loop quantum gravity better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does string theory.\n\nYou kids have fun.\n\nHang on a second.\n\nLoop quantum gravity clearly offers more testable predictions than string theory.\n\nI'm listening. Amuse me.\n\nFor one thing, we expect quantized space-time to manifest itself as minute differences in the speed of light for different colors.\n\nBalderdash.\n\nMatter clearly consists of tiny strings.\n\nAre you gonna let him talk to me like that?\n\nOkay, well, there is a lot of merit to both theories.\n\nNo, there isn't.\n\nOnly loop quantum gravity calculates the entropy of black holes.\n\nSheldon, don't make that noise.\n\nIt's disrespectful.\n\nI should hope so.\n\nIt was a snort of derision.\n\nYou agree with me, right?\n\nLoop quantum gravity is the future of physics.\n\nSorry, Leslie, I guess I prefer my space stringy, not loopy.\n\nI'm glad I found out the truth about you before this went any further.\n\nTruth? What truth?\n\nWe're talking about untested hypothes.\n\nIt's no big deal.\n\nIt isn't? Really?\n\nTell me, how will we raise the children?\n\nI guess we wait until they're old enough and let them choose their own theory.\n\nWe can't let them choose.\n\nThey're children!\n\nWhere are you going?\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nI could have accepted our kids being genetically unable to eat ice cream or ever get a good view of a parade.\n\nBut this?\n\nThis is a deal breaker.\n\nLook on the bright side.\n\nWhat's the bright side?\n\nOnly nine more months to Comic-con.\n\nCaptain, I'm getting an unusual reading.\n\nThat's great.\n\nYou guys want corn dogs?\n\nThat's a temporal anomaly.\n\nCorn dog's didn't come into existence till the first half of the 20th century.\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "c95f03c4-8038-44f6-94a7-15cd8261ea93": {"__data__": {"id_": "c95f03c4-8038-44f6-94a7-15cd8261ea93", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "51f6a5ad7c8e4d50fae9ff577afa75c70e17ceb85b30464915882c2dce147d37", "text": "\n\nFellow warriors, this is Sheldor the Conqueror.\n\nWe are about to enter\n\nAxidus' fortress.\n\nNow, this is a long run, so let's do another bladder check.\n\nOK, Barry, we'll wait for you again, but you really should see a doctor.\n\nSheldor is AFK.\n\nAre you experiencing some sort of difficulty?\n\nYes.

Well... you wouldn't even be nominated.\n\nDr. Gablehauser, I have a series of important calculations and simulations to run.\n\nAll she's doing is reducing irrelevant data and making a mock...\n\nExcuse me.\n\nIt's for you.\n\nPenny, this is not a good time.\n\nNo, I told you, you're not prepared for the Sanctum of Burning Souls.\n\nYou need to be in a group of at least 5 for that quest and one should be a level 35 healer.\n\nI can't log on and help you.\n\nWe'll talk when I get home.\n\nI'm not getting the computing time, am I?\n\nDumb-ass.\n\nLeonard, you have to do something about Penny.\n\nShe is interfering with my sleep, she's interfering with my work, and if I had another significant aspect of my life,\n\nI'm sure she'd be interfering with that, too.\n\nWhy should I do something?\n\nYes, but you're the one who said hello to her when she moved in.\n\nIf you'd simply restrained yourself, none of this would be happening.\n\nJust tell her to leave you alone.\n\nI did, I told her,\n\nI texted her, I sent out a very emphatic twitter.\n\nI even changed my Facebook status to \"Sheldon Cooper wishes Penny would leave him alone.\"\n\nI don't know what else to do.\n\nWell, what am I supposed to do?\n\nI don't know, but if you don't figure something out,\n\nI warn you,\n\nI shall become very difficult to live with.\n\nYou mean up until now we've been experiencing the happy, fun-time Sheldon?\n\nYes.\n\nI'll go talk to her.\n\nNo, Fritz, I need you on my flank.\n\nNo, I don't know German.\n\nHey, Penny.\n\nBusy.\n\nYeah, I see that.\n\nShouldn't you be at work?\n\nI don't work on Mondays.\n\nIt's Thursday.\n\nListen, Penny...\n\nQueen Penelope, AFK. What...?\n\nHere's the thing.\n\nSometimes people, good people, start playing these games and they find themselves, through no fault of their own, kind of... addicted.\n\nGet to the point.\n\nI'm about to level up here.\n\nIf a person doesn't have a sense of achievement in their real life, it's easy to lose themselves in a virtual world where they can get a false sense of accomplishment.\n\nYeah, jabber, jabber.\n\nBoys, Queen Penelope's back online.\n\nPenny, you've got...\n\nCheetos in your hair.\n\nThanks.\n\nHey, Penny, it's me again, Leonard.\n\nI said not now.\n\nI know, I'm just a little concerned about you.\n\nI said not now!\n\nOkay, maybe later.\n\nHey, guys.\n\nWhat's with him?\n\nPenny's been keeping him up at night.\n\nMe, too.\n\nBut probably in a different way.\n\nShe's gotten really hooked on Age of Conan.\n\nShe's playing nonstop.\n\nYes, online gaming addiction.\n\nThere's nothing worse than having that multi-player monkey on your back.\n\nSheldon, wake up!\n\nDanger! Danger!\n\nAfternoon, men.\n\nYour attempt at juvenilizing me by excluding me from the set of adult males, just...\n\nI'm too tired to do this.\n\nI heard you've been pulling all-nighters with Middle Earth Barbie.\n\nShe comes into my room.\n\nNo one's supposed to be in my room.\n\nI would postulate that she's escaping into the online world to compensate for her sexual frustration.\n\nI do that, too.\n\nBut probably in a different way.\n\nThat's not what she's doing, Leslie.\n\nShe's just trying to shore up her self-esteem.\n\nIt has nothing to do with sex.\n\nEverything has to do with sex.\n\nTestify.\n\nI'm not touching that.\n\nYou are way off base here.\n\nHang on.\n\nWhile I have no respect for Leslie as a scientist or a human being, for that matter, we have to concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields of promiscuity and general sluttiness.\n\nThank you.\n\nMy point is that Tinkerbell just needs to get her some.\n\nSome what?\n\nYes, some sexual intercourse.\n\nI'll take the bullet.\n\nExcuse me, this whole idea is insane.\n\nEnough debate,\n\nI'm going to take action.\n\nExcuse me.\n\nAre you currently involved in a sexual relationship?\n\nWould you like to be?\n\nSure, why not?\n\nCan I have your phone number?\n\nThere.

I totally like to initiate.\n\nI'm a big ol' five.\n\nGood to know.\n\nBig ol' five.\n\nLeonard, this is Tom.\n\nHi, Tom. Sheldon...\n\nDidn't I explain to you about your little mistake in the cafeteria?\n\nYou were very clear.\n\nAs was everyone else at the table.\n\nTom, however, has been chosen by science as a suitable mate for Penny.\n\nChosen by science?\n\nWell, what passes for science on dating sites.\n\nThey claim to use heuristic algorithms, but it may well be hokum.\n\nYou got Penny to sign up for online dating?\n\nNo, of course not.\n\nSee, I used trickery and deceit.\n\nThis is bad.\n\nTom is a paramedic with the fire department, but he's going to med school at night.\n\nHe likes the outdoors and strong women who initiate sex.\n\nReally, really bad.\n\nI'm surprised you struck out with Penny.\n\nApparently, she's a big ol' five.\n\nSheldon, what do you want?\n\nGood, you got my note.\n\nI'd like you to meet Tom.\n\nPenny, this is Tom.\n\nTom, may I present Penny.\n\nHi, Penny.\n\nYeah, hi.

P's.\n\nThere's a tribe in Papua New Guinea where, when a hunter flaunts his success to the rest of the village, they kill him and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin.\n\nSuperstious nonsense, of course, but one can see their point.\n\nHere you go, Raj.\n\nYou might want to drink this one slowly.\n\nSo, Saturday night, can I count on my posse?\n\nGee, I'd love to, Raj, but I can't make it.\n\nNo, I could...\n\nI can make it. But I won't.\n\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nThere's a reception for my magazine article on Saturday.\n\nAnd you guys aren't going?\n\nI can't believe you. Raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment and you're not even going to support him?\n\nA tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary body he discovered were plummeting toward Earth and he exploded it with his mind.\n\nThat would be cool.\n\nI'd go to that reception.\n\nCome on, this is huge.\n\nRaj is gonna be in <i>People magazine</i>, and he didn't even have to knock up one of the Spears sisters.\n\nWould you like to go with me?\n\nOf course I would.\n\nI would be honored.\n\nReally? Cool.\n\nShame on you guys.\n\nLook at that,\n\nI got a date with Penny.\n\nI can't believe it took you a whole year.\n\nNow?\n\nNow.\n\nHey, buddy,\n\nI'm going to be in <i>People magazine</i>.\n\nYeah, call me when you're on the cover.\n\nRaj, look at you!\n\nI know. I'm resplendent like the noonday sun, am I not?\n\nYeah. Starting with the champagne a little early, aren't you?\n\nIt was in the limo.\n\nThey sent a limo.\n\nI have a limo.\n\nI just love saying \"limo.\"\n\nSip on it while you're getting ready.\n\nI'm ready.\n\nThat's what you're wearing?\n\nWhy, what's wrong with it?\n\nNothing. I was just hoping for something a little more, you know, ridonkulous.\n\nYeah. Well, this is all the donkulous you're gonna get tonight.\n\nOkey-dokey, let's roll.\n\nAll right, it's time to raise the roof!\n\nHey, Leonard.\n\nDude.\n\nYou look very nice.\n\nThank you.\n\nCome on.

Come on.\n\nGood news.

The evening's not over.\n\nYes, it is.\n\nNo, it's time to put on some R.

I'll talk to him.\n\nYeah, you do that.\n\nJust so I know, would you be open to taking his class?\n\nYou can do it online!\n\nSo based on our triangulation, we've narrowed down the location of the house to three square miles in the Hollywood Hills.\n\nOr possibly Durham, North Carolina.\n\nWhen we find it, you want to go with us?\n\nTo do what?\n\nParty with the pretty girls, dude!\n\nAre you insane?\n\nYou're not going to party with them.\n\nYou're not even going to get anywhere near that place.\n\nThat's what they said to Neil Armstrong about the moon.\n\nNo one said anything of the kind to Neil Armstrong.\n\nThe entire nation dedicated a decade of effort and treasure to put a man on the moon.\n\nWell, my fellow Americans, before this year is out, we will put a Wolowitz on one of America's top models.\n\nAnd a large number of people will believe it never happened.\n\nOkay, let me guess.\n\nA quesadilla with soy cheese for the lactose-intolerant Leonard.\n\nThank you.\n\nShrimp Caesar salad with no almonds for the highly allergic kosher-only-on-the-high-holidays Howard.\n\nAnd for our suddenly \"back on the Hindu wagon\" Raj, the meatlover's pizza, no meat.\n\nComing right up.\n\nWait. Excuse me.\n\nYou forgot my barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.\n\nI didn't tell you? You're banished from the Cheesecake Factory.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, you have three strikes.\n\nOne: coming in.\n\nTwo: sitting down.\n\nAnd three:\n\nI don't like your attitude.\n\nYou can't do that.\n\nNot only is it a violation of California state law, it flies directly in the face of Cheesecake Factory policy.\n\nYeah, no, there's a new policy:\n\nNo shoes, no shirt, no Sheldon.\n\nI bet we could sell that sign all over Pasadena.\n\nCan I talk to you for a minute?\n\nHere's the thing.\n\nI talked to Sheldon and he feels terrible and he agrees that he was unreasonable and out of line.\n\nReally? That's great.\n\nSo just apologize to him, okay?\n\nWhat? I'm not going to apologize to that nutcase.\n\nCome on. It's easy.\n\nHe'll even tell you what to say.\n\nDon't you get it? If you guys keep going along with his insanity, you're just encouraging him.\n\nWe're not encouraging.\n\nIt's more like... knuckling under.\n\nI like hanging out with you, but I'm not gonna apologize for something I didn't do.\n\nWell, actually, technically, you did do it.\n\nThat's strike one, Leonard.\n\nThere you go: quesadilla.\n\nSalad.\n\nThere's your pizza.\n\nAnd thanks to Sheldon's heated discussion with my manager one barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.\n\nThank you.\n\nGo ahead. Eat it.\n\nI dare you.\n\nThat's it. There's the house.\n\nI found America's top models!\n\nAre you sure?\n\nLook, on the roof.\n\nAnais and Giselle are sunbathing.\n\nEuropean-style.\n\nYou can recognize people on Google Earth?\n\nOf course not. I got a buddy of mine at NORAD to have a spy drone fly over.\n\nNORAD?\n\nYou're using military aircraft?\n\nIt was already targeted to poke around a nuclear reactor in Siberia.\n\nI took it an hour out of its way, tops.\n\nWhere is he?\n\nSheldon? I just dropped him off at the comic book store. Why?\n\nHere. Try and go online.\n\nProblem with the WiFi?\n\nJust try. with your little friends</i> you \"heart\" various things.</i> that I am putting an end</i> upon our WiFi.</i> the situation,</i> the phone company,</i> and pay for it,</i>\n\nI reiterate: knuckle under.\n\nNo, no. It is on.\n\nI am gonna introduce your friend to a world of hurt.\n\nYou don't want to get into it with Sheldon.\n\nThe guy is one lab accident away from being a supervillain.\n\nI don't care. I was in junior rodeo.\n\nI can hogtie and castrate him in 60 s.\n\nNo need to neuter the nerd.\n\nI can get you back online.\n\nThere, see? Problem solved. to circumvent my will,</i> one additional strike.</i>\n\nThanks a lot.\n\nWhat are you complaining about?\n\nI have to take the class again.\n\nTime to do your laundry, huh?\n\nIt's Saturday night.\n\nSaturday is laundry night.\n\nI know.\n\nEvery Saturday at 8:15.\n\nEasy to anticipate.\n\nWhat are you implying?\n\nI'm implying that you're a creature of habit.\n\nAnd if something were to prevent you from doing your laundry on Saturday at 8:15, you might find it... unpleasant.\n\nKnuckle under? My ass.\n\nAre all the machines taken?\n\nWhat are you gonna do?\n\nNo problem.\n\nI'll just... do my laundry another night.\n\nAnother night?\n\nWell, I guess you can try, but... deep inside your heart, you'll know that laundry night is always Saturday night.\n\nWoman, you are playing with forces beyond your ken.\n\nYeah, well, your ken can kiss my Barbie.\n\nWhere are my clothes?\n\nYour clothes?\n\nI left them in the washers and when I went down, they were gone.\n\nReally?\n\nDespite the sign that says \"Do not leave laundry unattended\"?\n\nWhere are my clothes?\n\nYou know, I do recall seeing some female undergarments.\n\nWhere was that?\n\nEarlier this evening,\n\nI happened to gaze out the window and a brassiere caught my eye.\n\nDo those look familiar?\n\nHow the hell did you get them up on that telephone wire?\n\nWhen you understand the laws of physics, anything is possible.\n\nAnd may I add: mwuh-ha-ha.\n\nGet them down.\n\nApologize.\n\nNever.\n\nThen may I suggest you get a very long stick and play panty piata.\n\nWait, Sheldon, this has gotten out of hand, okay?\n\nI've done some stupid things.\n\nYou've done some stupid things.\n\nHow about we call it even and move on with our lives?\n\nI've done no stupid things.\n\nYou gotta meet me halfway here.\n\nI am meeting you halfway,\n\nI'm willing to concede that you've done stupid things.\n\nYou guys are talking again.\n\nGood.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nRemember when I said it was on?\n\nWell, now it's junior rodeo on.\n\nNot junior rodeo.\n\nWhat did you do?\n\nI had no choice, Leonard.\n\nShe ruined laundry night.\n\nMwuh-ha-ha.\n\nTelephone wires can't electrocute you, can they?\n\nLook, this has to stop.\n\nNo, no. It is just beginning.\n\nAll right.\n\nI really didn't want to do this, but... here.\n\nWhat's this?\n\nSheldon's Kryptonite.\n\nOh, my God.\n\nHe can never know that I gave that to you.\n\nLook, I said\n\nI wanted to hurt him, but... but this?\n\nIt'll shorten the war by five years and save millions of lives.\n\nPause it.\n\nThat's it. Confirmed.\n\nWe now have the address of the Top Model house.\n\nGod bless you,\n\nGoogle Street View registered trademark.\n\nFor the record, what you're doing is really creepy.\n\nYou know what? If it's \"creepy\" to use the Internet, military satellites, and robot aircraft to find a house full of gorgeous young models so that I can drop in on them unexpectedly, then fine, I'm \"creepy.\"\n\nHold on a second, I'll get him.\n\nSheldon, it's for you.\n\nWho is it?\n\nYour mother.\n\nOh, good.\n\nHi, Mom. How are you?\n\nBut, Mom... she keeps sitting in my spot.\n\nAnd she touched my food.\n\nOkay, yes, I took her clothes, but she started it...\n\nNo, that's not fair.\n\nWhy should I have to apologize?\n\nI don't think this is the kind of thing\n\nJesus concerns himself with.\n\nNo, you're right.\n\nI don't really know what Jesus thinks about.\n\nAll right, good-bye.\n\nDid you tell on me?\n\nAre you kidding me?\n\nI already have two strikes.\n\nI am very, very sorry for what I have done.\n\nHere's your laundry.\n\nI rescind your strikes and you are no longer banished.\n\nCan I sit wherever I want?\n\nNever mind, never mind.\n\nThat's not important.\n\nSheldon, this was big of you.\n\nThank you. I really appreciate it.\n\nThank you.\n\nWell played.\n\nThank you.\n\nJust remember: with great power comes great responsibility.\n\nUnderstood.\n\nCan I help you?\n\nWe're here to fix the cable.\n\nI think we have satellite.\n\nThat's what I meant.\n\nCome on in.\n\nShe's taller than all the women in my family combined.\n\nWhat do we do now?\n\nFollow Mrs. Wolowitz.\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "e14337e9-062c-4616-b1e4-54f31dc7a52f": {"__data__": {"id_": "e14337e9-062c-4616-b1e4-54f31dc7a52f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "03e7c59cda48159e4a118a9890f4e3222666f80887d64b7bee3a477ef64d9353", "text": "\n\nOh, look,\n\nI don't want to watch <i>Saturn 3</i>.\n\nHow is <i>Deep Space Nine</i> better than <i>Saturn 3</i>?\n\nSimple subtraction will tell you it's six better.\n\nCompromise.

Now, should that happen,\n\nI would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido.\n\nI could think about you.\n\nFine, whatever works.\n\nAlways nice talking to you, Sheldon.\n\nPeace out!\n\nSubtitles: sub-way.fr\n\nThis is very pleasant.\n\nGlad you're enjoying yourself.\n\nAnd you said there'd never be enough pasta for the three of us.\n\nI stand corrected.\n\nYou know, Italian housewives have a rule of thumb.\n\nA handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked.\n\nThat's very interesting.\n\nThank you.\n\nShe doesn't mean it.\n\nShe's just being nice.\n\nWell, since Leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball,\n\nI guess I'll just have to pick it up.\n\nHave you ever witnessed a violent crime?\n\nNo.\n\nGood.\n\nWhat's your favorite fruit?\n\nStrawberries.\n\nTechnically not a fruit, but all right.\n\nWhere did you do your medical internship?\n\nLawrence Memorial in Galveston, Texas.\n\nReally? That's where I was born!\n\nYou're kidding!\n\nI spent so much of my childhood at that hospital.\n\nWhen I was 12,\n\nI got to ride there in a helicopter.\n\nWhy, what happened?\n\nRadiation burns.\n\nA little mishap while I was building my own CAT scanner.\n\nI'm sorry, you tried to build your own CAT scanner?\n\nNo, I didn't try, I succeeded.\n\nIn fact, I was briefly able to see the inside of my sister's guinea pig, Snowball, before he caught fire.\n\nIt led to an interesting expression in our house: \"Not a Snowball's chance in a CAT scanner.\"\n\nExcuse me.\n\nWhen I come back, just for fun, the subject will be alternative history.\n\nSpecifically, how would the Civil War have gone differently if Lincoln had been a robot sent from the future?\n\nLook at that, there's even pasta left over.\n\nDo you understand that this was supposed to be a date?\n\nI do. Do you?\n\nBecause frankly, you've been in a foul mood since I sat down.\n\nOkay, here's my question.\n\nWhy did you sit down?\n\nTo help.\n\nLook, if you fail at this relationship, and history suggests you will, then we risk losing the medical officer that our landing party has always needed.\n\nWhat landing party?\n\nYou're Kirk, I'm Spock,\n\nWolowitz is Scotty,\n\nKoothrappali is the guy who always gets killed... and now we've got McCoy.\n\nSo, we're all standing around looking at the post-op X ray and there it is, clear as day, right in the guy's chest cavity... one of my earrings.\n\nOh, my God, what did you do?\n\nWhat do you think I did?\n\nI discreetly slipped off the other earring, put it in my pocket and then got the hell out of there!\n\nI have a bone to pick with you, sir.\n\nHi, Sheldon.\n\nHi, Stephanie. I'm sorry I'm late, but your companion left the most indecipherable invitation.\n\nWhat invitation? \"We're going to the movies.\"\n\nWhat movie? What theater? What time?\n\nIf you were trying to make it impossible to locate you, you couldn't have done a better job.\n\nClearly I could have.\n\nIt took me nearly 20 minutes to browse the history on your computer to see what movie times you looked up.\n\nWait here, I'll find us seats.\n\nWe have seats.\n\nNot the right seats.\n\nWhat is he doing?\n\nHe's finding the acoustic sweet spot.\n\nDoes he always do this?\n\nSometimes he brings a toy xylophone.\n\nI am really sorry about this.\n\nNo, it's fine.\n\nYou know, he's sweet.\n\nMy apologies, you've been sitting in it all along.\n\nYou want to slide over one?\n\nNo, just sit here.\n\nOh, yeah, this is it.\n\nWhat, Sheldon?\n\nWhat, Sheldon?! What, Sheldon?!\n\nTell me what you see here.\n\nThe blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?\n\nThis is Stephanie's Facebook page.\n\nNow, where it should say \"in a relationship,\" what does it say? \"Stephanie Barnett is single.\"\n\nFurthermore, earlier this evening, she threw a digital sheep at some guy named Mike.\n\nWho's Mike?!\n\nWhy does he get a digital sheep and not you?\n\nIt's just her Facebook page and we've only been going out a couple of weeks.\n\nYou don't see it, do you?\n\nWe're losing her.\n\nI'm going to make this very simple for you.\n\nYou are not in this relationship.\n\nI am.\n\nErgo, you have no say in anything that happens between me and Stephanie.\n\nI'm afraid I can't allow that.\n\nPursuant to Starfleet\n\nGeneral Order 104,\n\nSection A: You are deemed unfit and I hereby relieve you of your command.\n\nGeneral Order 104, Section A does not apply in this situation.\n\nGive me one good reason why not.\n\nBecause this is not <i>Star Trek</i>!\n\nWhat?\n\nThis is banana bread.\n\nThis is a door knob.\n\nIt's my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat.\n\nWould you like to come in?\n\nI suppose I could spare a few minutes.\n\nWere you robbed?\n\nHow can you be sure?\n\nWhat do you want?\n\nI'm certain this will come as no surprise to you, but Leonard is failing in yet another relationship.\n\nHe's having problems with Stephanie?\n\nShe's sending virtual livestock to random men on the Internet.\n\nIf I have any hope of keeping them together, I need data.\n\nSpecifically, I need to know exactly what Leonard did that caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks.\n\nWhat?\n\nAgain, urban slang.\n\nIn which, I believe I'm gaining remarkable fluency.\n\nSo, what is the \"down\" and the \"low\"?\n\nAnd don't worry, this is all entirely confidential, so, you feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom.\n\nWe never got to the bedroom.\n\nBecause?\n\nAll right, you know what?\n\nI'll tell you what happened.\n\nWe were young, we were very much in love, but we could only communicate through a time-traveling mailbox at my lake house.\n\nIt's not enough that you made me watch that movie, but now you mock me with it?\n\nGentlemen, I have a question about dating and relationships.\n\nYou told me you were going to have the talk with him.\n\nI've been waiting for someone to have the talk with me.\n\nMore to the point, it's about finding a way to keep Leonard and Stephanie together.\n\nI don't think you can.\n\nWhy not?\n\nLook at Leonard's record.\n\nDuring which she defected to North Korea.\n\nTwo booty calls with Leslie Winkle.\n\nFor which she awarded him the nickname \"Speed of Light Leonard.\"\n\nAnd the three hour dinner with Penny.\n\nWhich would have been two and a half if they ordered the souffle when they sat down.\n\nBased on the geometric progression, his relationship with Stephanie should have ended after 20 minutes.\n\nYes, I'm aware of the math.\n\nY equals 27 days over 12 to the nth.\n\nThe issue remains.\n\nHow do we circumvent his inevitable rejection?\n\nIf you want to guarantee his appeal to Stephanie, your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet.\n\nHere's what you shouldn't do.\n\nDon't shpritz him with that body spray from the commercial where the women undress when they smell it.\n\nThat doesn't work at all.\n\nNo matter how much you put on.\n\nThat's all you've got?\n\nApocalyptic genocide and \"go easy on the cologne\"?\n\nWhat?\n\nZucchini bread.\n\nThank you.\n\nMay I come in?\n\nI see.\n\nApparently, my earlier inquiry regarding you and Leonard crossed some sort of line.\n\nI apologize.\n\nWell, thank you.\n\nHave you and I returned to a social equilibrium?\n\nYes.\n\nGreat.\n\nNew topic.\n\nWhere are you in your menstrual cycle?\n\nWhat?!\n\nI've been doing some research online, and apparently, female primates, you know, apes, chimpanzees, you...\n\nThey find their mate more desirable when he's courted by another female.\n\nNow, this effect is intensified when the rival female is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation.\n\nWhich brings me back to my question.\n\nWhere are you...\n\nClearly, I'm 14 days too early.\n\nAll I'm saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria, why can't they do something about lactose intolerance?\n\nLeonard, you're going to have to let this go.\n\nYou had a little cheese dip, you farted.\n\nI thought it was cute.\n\nYou want some more wine?\n\nYeah, I mean...\n\nI assume I'm not driving anywhere tonight.\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\nI have a craving for white asparagus that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied.\n\nExcuse me.\n\nWhat is wrong with you?\n\nI'm helping you with Stephanie.\n\nBy making constipated moose sounds?\n\nWhen I fail to open this jar and you succeed, it will establish you as the \"alpha\" male.\n\nYou see... when a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination, she produces the hormone oxytocin.\n\nIf the two of you then engage in intercourse, this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain which lay people naively interpret as \"falling in love.\"\n\nWould it work if I just punched you in the face?\n\nYes, actually it would, but let's see how the lid goes.\n\nI'm not strong enough, Leonard, you'll have to do it.\n\nFor God's sakes.\n\nGo ahead, it's pre-loosened.\n\nYou want some help with that?\n\nI got it.\n\nHe's got it, and that's not surprising.\n\nIt's something I long ago came to peace with in my role as the beta male.\n\nOpen it.\n\nAre you okay?\n\nNo, I'm not.\n\nI'm bleeding.\n\nLike a gladiator!\n\nHoney, you're going to need stitches.\n\nStitches? With a needle?\n\nWell, yeah, I mean, just a few.\n\nYeah, hang on a sec.\n\nFYI, I was defrosting a steak in there.\n\nWhat a beautiful job Stephanie did.\n\nI might have gone with a mattress suture instead of a blanket stitch, but you can't argue with her results.\n\nIt's a shame it won't scar.\n\nThe war wound is a time-honored badge of masculinity.\n\nI can't remember a time when you weren't talking.\n\nJust for the record, my efforts to establish you as the alpha male were not aided by you bursting into tears.\n\nI did not burst into tears, my eyes just got a little watery.\n\nWatery?\n\nShe stuck a needle into my hand!\n\nHey, how's my big cry baby?\n\nI didn't cry.\n\nI'm just teasing you.\n\nBut, yeah, you did.\n\nIt's all good. What do you say we get you home and put you to bed?\n\nAre you still going to spend the night?\n\nNo, I think that you probably need to rest.\n\nShe's right. As long as you're vomiting, coitus is contra-indicated.\n\nThank you, Dr. Cooper.\n\nYou're welcome, Dr. Hofstadter.\n\nOkay, I'm going to go get your discharge papers.\n\nWhat?\n\nYou seem like a perfectly pleasant person.\n\nI can't understand why women have such a hard time loving you.\n\nCan you open this for me?\n\nCan I see your stitches?\n\nSure.\n\nAnswering the question once and for all why Wolowitz bailed out of medical school.\n\nLeonard, congratulations.\n\nWhat for?\n\nYour Facebook status update.\n\nLeonard Hofstadter is \"in a relationship.\"\n\nWhat? No, that's not right.\n\nOh, man, did you switch your status before she did?\n\nSpeaking as an expert, way to look needy.\n\nSeriously? You went first, after only two weeks?\n\nThat's bold...\n\nIt's not bold, it's a mistake.\n\nI didn't change my status.\n\nWell, then who did?\n\nI had no choice.\n\nHe cried in front of her.\n\nYou hacked my Facebook account?\n\nIt's hardly hacking when you use the same password for everything, \"Kal-El.\"\n\nAre you insane?\n\nNow she's going to think I'm desperate.\n\nYou've destroyed this relationship!\n\nAnd you know what the worst part is?\n\nYou don't even understand what you did wrong because you can't conceive of something that you are not an expert in!\n\nIn which I am not an expert.\n\nDon't even!\n\nI don't want to hear another word out of you.\n\nWhat's wrong, Lassie?\n\nTimmy fall down the well?\n\nShe just updated her Facebook status. \"Stephanie Barnett is in a relationship \"with Leonard Hofstadter.\"\n\nReally?\n\nLook at that.\n\nI have a girlfriend.\n\nIf I am permitted to speak again,\n\nDr. Sheldon Cooper for the win.\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "4d384947-49a7-4a89-b9bf-a64796984cad": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d384947-49a7-4a89-b9bf-a64796984cad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "5e2a187c1e98dcbf71664710bd52da4cb348e21673e5b579f1688937fad4ed1a", "text": "\n\nI don't see anything at all.\n\nYou're the doctor, but I am constantly hearing this annoying sound.\n\nMe, too.\n\nIs it a high-frequency whistle?\n\nNo, it's more of a relentless, narcissistic drone.\n\nThere's no inflammation at all.\n\nThen it must be a tumor.\n\nSeriously doubt it.\n\nMaybe it's a lingering bacterial infection from all those childhood toilet swirlies.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nI used to get those all the time.\n\nEven in church.\n\nIf it is from a swirly, there something I can do.\n\nCircle, circle, dot, dot, now you have a cootie shot!\n\nI'm going to bed.\n\nOkay, I'll be right in.\n\nIt's not enough that she mocks me, but that isn't even the correct procedure for a cootie shot.\n\nDo you understand that Stephanie's not here to treat your imaginary ailments?\n\nHow is it imaginary that I keep hearing an octave above Middle C?\n\nIs that imaginary?\n\nI don't think so.\n\nGood night.\n\nOne more thing.\n\nUnder Article One, Section Three of our Roommate Agreement,\n\nI'm calling an emergency meeting.\n\nYou're not.\n\nLeonard moves the meeting not occur.\n\nIs there a second?\n\nNone heard, the motion fails.\n\nI'd like to begin the meeting by congratulating you on the progress in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie.\n\nThank you.\n\nThat being said, we have to discuss the implementation of the agreed upon \"cohabitation\" rider which has been activated now the two of you are living together.\n\nWe're not living together.\n\nI beg to disagree. \"A girlfriend shall be deemed quote living with un-quote Leonard when she has stayed over for A: ten consecutive nights, or B: more than nine nights in a three week period, or C: all the weekends of a given month plus three weeknights.\n\nThat's absurd.\n\nYou initialed it.\n\nSee?

Just... rethinking my whole life.\n\nHere's the thing.\n\nI'm afraid that if I ask her to move out, she'll just dump me.\n\nIt's a chance you have to take.\n\nI mean, look, if it's meant to be, it'll be.\n\nVery comforting.\n\nWhat do I say to her?\n\nI don't know.\n\nWhat have women said to you when they wanted to slow a relationship down?\n\nI really like you, but I want to see how things go with Mark?\n\nYeah, that'll slow it down.\n\nI'm sorry, I totally interrupted you.\n\nWhat were you saying?\n\nRight, yeah...\n\nHere's the thing.\n\nI really like you.\n\nGod, here comes the speech.\n\nWhat speech? \"I really like you, \"but maybe we should spend a little less time together \"'cause I need my space \"but I'll call you on Tuesday\" and then you never call me, so I call you, but you don't call me back and then when I run into you at the coffee shop, you pretend like you've been having problems with your voice mail and I know that you're lying, but I pretend like I don't care even though I'm dying inside!\n\nI wasn't going to say any of that.\n\nI was just going to say...\n\nI really like you.\n\nOh, good!

I have no desire to get in the water till I absolutely have to.\n\nTell me another interest of yours.\n\nHe's stuck in an infinite loop.\n\nI can fix it.\n\nInteresting, but isn't ventriloquism by definition a solo activity?\n\nTell me another interest of yours.\n\nIs there any chance you like monkeys?\n\nWhat is wrong with you?\n\nEverybody likes monkeys.\n\nHang on, Kripke.\n\nA loop counter and an escape to the least objectionable activity.\n\nHoward, that's brilliant.\n\nI'm surprised you saw that.\n\nGee, why can't Sheldon make friends?\n\nAll right, Kripke, that last interest strikes me as the least objectionable, and I would like to propose that we do that together.\n\nTomorrow.\n\nYes, I'll pay.\n\nAll right, good-bye.\n\nAll right.\n\nTime to learn rock climbing.\n\nYou know, I am a fan of ventriloquism.\n\nMaybe you, me and your dummy could go get a hot beverage.\n\nHe could talk while you drink.\n\nNope. I wanna climb some rocks.\n\nThis appears significantly more monolithic than it did on my laptop.\n\nOne expects to see hominids learning to use bones as weapons.\n\nYou afraid of heights, Cooper?\n\nHardly.\n\nA fear of heights is illogical.\n\nA fear of falling, on the other hand, is prudent and evolutionary.\n\nWhat would you say is the minimum altitude I need to achieve to cement our newfound friendship?\n\nThey have birthday parties here.\n\nLittle kids climb this.\n\nLittle kid hominids perhaps.\n\nSo is this your entire job?\n\nYour parents must be so proud.\n\nLet's go, Cooper.\n\nI'm coming, Kripke.\n\nThe harness seems to be secure.\n\nA small amount of incontinence just now, but the Web site said that's to be expected.\n\nThis isn't so bad.\n\nIt's like vertical swimming.\n\nLook at you.\n\nYou're almost halfway to the top.\n\nI am?\n\nI was wrong.\n\nIt is a fear of heights.\n\nYou all right there, Cooper?\n\nNot really.\n\nI feel somewhat like an inverse tangent function that's approached an asymptote.\n\nAre you saying you're stuck?\n\nWhat part of inverse tangent function approaching an asymptote did you not understand?\n\nI understood all of it.\n\nI'm not a moron.\n\nJust keep going.\n\nYeah, I don't think I can.\n\nWell, then climb back down.\n\nNo, that doesn't seem any more likely.\n\nWhat's your plan?\n\nWell, it's not exactly a plan, but I think I'm going to pass out.\n\nSorry, can we please just do it one more time?\n\nOne, two, one, two, three, and...\n\nIt's a little thing, but you really do miss it.\n\nHello, everyone.\n\nI brought my new friend\n\nBarry Kripke home for dinner.\n\nHello to you, too.\n\nHow was rock climbing?\n\nHe passed out.\n\nJust hung there like a big salami.\n\nThat's where I sit.\n\nYou have a special spot?\n\nWhat kind of wacko are you?\n\nHow much time you got?\n\nYou want some Chinese food?\n\nTerrific. Got any dental floss?\n\nIn the bathroom.\n\nBe right back.\n\nI got to floss the Indian food out of my teeth if I'm gonna eat Chinese.\n\nSheldon, are you okay?\n\nYes, I pass out all the time, but it was worth it.\n\nI've made substantial progress in bonding with Kripke, which brings me to an awkward moment.\n\nWhat's that?\n\nMaintaing five friendships promises to be a Herculean task, so...\n\nI'm going to have to let one of you go.\n\nMe, me, let it be me.\n\nLeonard, you are my roommate, my source of transportation, and you help me fold my sheets when they come out of the dryer.\n\nYou are safe.\n\nCan I whistle?\n\nDon't be silly.\n\nYou do not have a PhD; your cologne is an assault on the senses; and you're not available for video games during the Jewish high holidays.\n\nGuilty as charged. I'm out.\n\nYou too are safe.\n\nCome on. What do I have to do?\n\nOkay, you know what?\n\nI see where this is going.\n\nI'm not one of you guys.\n\nI'm not a scientist, so just tell me...\n\nEverything you're saying is true, but please allow me to continue.\n\nYou're out.\n\nThat's a good question.\n\nWhile you do provide a certain cultural diversity to an otherwise homogenous group, your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing.\n\nHow could you for a moment think my favorite amino acid is glutamine?\n\nHe had lysine, but changed it.\n\nShoulda, woulda, coulda, Raj.\n\nI like to floss before I eat so my gum pockets are open for new food.\n\nHow did I walk past you?\n\nI'm Barry.\n\nThat's not a very hot name.\n\nI'm going to call you Roxanne.\n\nPot stickers.\n\nSuddenly, I'm looking pretty good, huh?\n\nSo, Kripke, I was wondering if there's any chance you could get me some time on the open science grid computer?\n\nBut we're friends.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nNo, my friend.\n\nI'm confused.\n\nI was given to understand that you allow your friends time on the machine.\n\nNo, that's wrong.\n\nThere's an official schedule.\n\nI have no control over it.\n\nThis entire endeavor seems to have been an exercise in futility.\n\nRaj, you're back in.\n\nHe likes monkeys.\n\nYou've got to give him credit for sticking with it.\n\nI didn't think he had it in him.\n\nAnd he almost made it to the top this time.\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "15c02624-3dd5-4880-b83c-cf999a1bbfe7": {"__data__": {"id_": "15c02624-3dd5-4880-b83c-cf999a1bbfe7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "b0f0f0b485a133b1cecc87f4f70db17bdb23d48e61fe916640e7746901809219", "text": "\n\nThe problem appears to be unsolvable.\n\nMaybe we could run some computer simulations.\n\nThere are too many variables.\n\nIt would take forever.\n\nWe've got to be missing something.\n\nLet's start again.\n\nThe movie is playing here at 7:20, here at 7:40, here at 8:10 and here at 8:45.\n\nThese theaters have to be eliminated.\n\nWhy?

I'll do the talking.\n\nYou just stand behind me and try to look formidable.\n\nI should've peed before we left.\n\nHi, Kurt.\n\nLenny, right?\n\nI don't really go by Lenny, but that's okay.\n\nYou remember\n\nSheldon, Howard and Raj.\n\nWhat do you want?\n\nYou don't remember me?\n\nHow could he not rember me?\n\nNot now.\n\nI remember him.\n\nHere it is.\n\nPenny's in kind of a financial jam, and the money that you owe her would go a long way to solving her problems.\n\nShe sent you to get it from me?\n\nNo, no, she's too proud to ask for the money.\n\nI, on the other hand, feel you should honor your debt.\n\nYou do? \"Feel\" is a kind of a... it's a strong word.\n\nI just think it would be a nice gesture on your part.\n\nShe'll get it when she gets it.\n\nWell, there you go.\n\nProblem solved.\n\nA successful quest.

I can't seem to get the hang of that.\n\nI know it's none of my business, but where did the money come from?\n\nWell, I cut back my expenses like you said and picked up a few more hours at the restaurant, but the biggest thing was, out of the blue, Kurt shows up and gives me the money he owes me.\n\nReally?\n\nDid he say why?\n\nHe said he was feeling guilty and wanted to do what was right.\n\nThat's it?\n\nDid he give any reason as to why he came to this moral epiphany?\n\nI just think he's really changed.\n\nWe're having dinner tomorrow night, and I get to wear my new beret.\n\nBye, guys.\n\nWell done, Leonard.\n\nThe true hero doesn't seek adulation.\n\nHe fights for right and justice simply because it's his nature.\n\nPenny's hooking up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend, and I have indelible ink on my forehead!\n\nThat's your badge of honor... your warrior's wound, if you will.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nMinstrels will write songs about you.\n\nGreat. named Leonard</i>\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "aa22edad-0c2b-4a98-8fb2-5583633ab4af": {"__data__": {"id_": "aa22edad-0c2b-4a98-8fb2-5583633ab4af", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "0788e4735986aa73962199e724bce8cf0f751ecf9c9bc6990c2f449c5329bddb", "text": "\n\nFellas, please.\n\nPenny, come on.\n\nWe were just finding our sound.\n\nYou found it.\n\nIt's the sound of a cat being run over by a lawn mower.\n\nI'm really very busy.\n\nIs there any way that we can put this off until I have more time to prepare?\n\nOf course.\n\nBut, you understand my trepidation.\n\nWhat's that about?\n\nNot a clue.\n\nCan't we just postpone it till the spring?\n\nMaybe next summer?\n\nThis should be fairly easy to deduce.\n\nHe's holding the phone to his left ear.\n\nEars do not cross hemispheres, so he's using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain, suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller.\n\nNo, I didn't realize it had been so long.\n\nSure, I guess there's no other choice but to just go ahead and do it.\n\nHe's referring to an activity he has done before.\n\nIt's unpleasant and needs to be repeated.\n\nThis suggests some sort of invasive medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy.\n\nAren't there any other options?\n\nThere's not a lot of room.\n\nIt's gonna be uncomfortable.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nI'm definitely going with colonoscopy.\n\nOkay, bye.\n\nMy mother's coming to visit.\n\nHow about that, you were right.\n\nSubtitles: sub-way.fr\n\nTranscript: YYeTs\n\nIt's out of order.\n\nYes, I can read the sign.\n\nI'm just pondering the implications.\n\nI think it implies that the elevator doesn't work.\n\nAgain, I can read the sign.\n\nBut the sign and the tape are covered with a layer of dust, which indicates that the elevator has been nonfunctional for a significant amount of time.\n\nWhich suggests either a remarkable passivity among the, I assume, based on the number of mailboxes and given typical urban population density or a shared delusion of functionality.\n\nYou must be Leonard's mother.\n\nI don't know if I must be, but yes.\n\nI'm Penny.\n\nI'm his neighbor.\n\nDr. Beverly Hofstadter.\n\nNice to meet you.\n\nYou're a hand shaker.\n\nInteresting.\n\nCome with me.\n\nI'll walk you to the apartment.\n\nWould you like to exchange pleasantries on the way?\n\nYeah, sure, I guess.\n\nAll right, you start.\n\nI've always been curious. What was\n\nLeonard like when he was little?\n\nI think you mean young.\n\nHe's always been little.\n\nRight.\n\nWhat was he like when he was young?\n\nYou'll have to be more specific.\n\nOkay, like, five or six.\n\nFive.\n\nAt that age, he was well enmeshed in what Freud would call the phallic stage of psychosexual development.\n\nAn outmoded theory, of course, but the boy did spend most of his waking hours with a tight grasp on his penis.\n\nLeonard mentioned you were a psychiatrist.\n\nThat is one of my degrees.\n\nMy primary field is neuroscience.\n\nWell, I'm an actress.\n\nWhy?\n\nWhat do you mean why?\n\nThere are studies that suggest that many who go into the performing arts suffer from an external locus of identity.\n\nYeah, I don't know what that means.\n\nIt means you value yourself only as others value you, which is often the result of unmet childhood emotional needs.\n\nI had a wonderful childhood.\n\nTell me about it.\n\nI know my dad wanted a boy.\n\nI tried being good at sports, but I hated getting dirty!\n\nAnd then, I'm assuming, you entered adolescence.\n\nHe called me Slugger until I got my first training bra.\n\nAnd then he just stopped playing catch with me.\n\nI wasn't Slugger anymore.\n\nYour mother's here!\n\nIf you want to have intercourse with that girl, find out what kind of cologne her father wore.\n\nGood to see you, Mother.\n\nHere's your tea, Mother.\n\nOolong?\n\nLoose, not bagged?\n\nSteeped three minutes?\n\nTwo-percent milk?\n\nWarmed separately?\n\nOne teaspoon sugar?\n\nRaw sugar?\n\nIt's cold.\n\nI'll start again.\n\nI have the same problem with him.\n\nMy theory is that his lack of focus stems from an over-developed sex drive.\n\nI don't know where he would've gotten that.\n\nAside from a pro forma consummation of our marriage, his father and I only had intercourse for the purposes of reproduction.\n\nThat seems a fairly efficient arrangement.\n\nYes, we think so.\n\nWe've both done papers on it.\n\nMine from the neuroscientific point of view and his from an anthropological.\n\nMine, of course, was the onlyne worth reading.\n\nOf course.\n\nI would very much like to read about your sex life.\n\nIt's all online or you can order it from the Princeton University Press.\n\nHere's your tea, Mother.\n\nSo, what are you guys talking about?\n\nThe frequency with which your parents had intercourse.\n\nSwell.\n\nIf you're lucky, maybe she'll show you the PowerPoint presentation.\n\nI'm sorry, it's on my other laptop.\n\nSo, Mother... what's new?\n\nYou'll have to be more specific.\n\nAll right.\n\nWhat's new with you?\n\nWell, I've been having some fascinating menopausal symptoms recently.\n\nMaybe something less personal.\n\nYour Uncle Floyd died.\n\nOh, my God.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nHis heart stopped beating.\n\nI have to urinate.\n\nWhat a remarkable woman.\n\nYeah, I-I thought you guys might hit it off.\n\nI envy you your childhood.\n\nI hate to tell you, but the only warm memories\n\nI have of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd.\n\nYou're clearly misremembering.\n\nYour mother is brilliant, analytical, insightful.\n\nAnd I'm betting she never hit you with a Bible because you wouldn't eat your Brussels sprouts.\n\nYou don't give your mother enough credit.\n\nShe's warm, she's loving, she doesn't glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves while potty training.\n\nYou were lucky.\n\nWhen I was a kid, if I wanted an EEG,\n\nI had to attach my own electrodes.\n\nSo, Dr. Hofstadter,\n\nLeonard rarely talks about his incredibly successful brother and sister.\n\nPlease, don't go there.\n\nI understand that, unlike Leonard, they're at the top of their respective fields.\n\nBoy, you suck.\n\nLeonard's younger brother, Michael, is a tenured law professor at Harvard, and his sister just successfully grew a human pancreas in an adolescent gibbon.\n\nSo, she's close to curing diabetes?\n\nWhy else would you grow a pancreas in a teenaged gibbon?\n\nYou must be very proud.\n\nWhy?\n\nThey're not my accomplishments.\n\nI have to urinate.\n\nWhy are you doing this?\n\nYou know the rules.\n\nYou brought your mom to work... you must suffer.\n\nI had no idea your siblings were so much more successful than you.\n\nYou're like the Jar Jar Binks of the Hofstadter family.\n\nOh, mesa think yousa lookin' so so sad.\n\nRather than mock me, my friends might realize that this is difficult and try to help me through it.\n\nNope, I think mocking you is more fun.\n\nNext time, don't yousa bring mama to work. Okee-day?\n\nThat was fast.\n\nThe middle stall was occupied.\n\nI'll have to try again later.\n\nThat's totally understandable.\n\nIn bladder voiding, as in real estate, it's location, location, location.\n\nSo, where were we?\n\nHoward lives with his mother and Raj can't speak to women unless he's drunk. Go.\n\nThat's fascinating.\n\nSelective mutism is quite rare.\n\nOn the other hand, an adult Jewish male living with his mother is so common it borders on sociological clich.\n\nIt's just temporary; I pay rent.\n\nHe lives in the same room where his bassinet was.\n\nBoth selective mutism and an inability to separate from one's mother can stem from a pathological fear of women.\n\nIt might explain why the two of you have created an ersatz homosexual marriage to satisfy your need for intimacy.\n\nSay what?\n\nThat's basically what I just said.\n\nYou brought your husband to work.\n\nYou know the rules.\n\nMeesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too, betcha, betcha.\n\nLeonard, it's 1:00. Weren't you going to show me your laboratory at 1:00?\n\nThere's no hurry. Tell them more about their secret love for each other.\n\nBut it's 1:00. You were going to show me your laboratory at 1:00.\n\nHer reasoning is unassailable.\n\nIt is 1:00.\n\nFine. Let's go.\n\nI think you'll find my work pretty interesting.\n\nI'm attempting to replicate the dark matter signal found in sodium iodide crystals by the Italians.\n\nSo, no original research?\n\nWhat's the point of my seeing it?\n\nI could just read the paper the Italians wrote.\n\nJust for the record, we're not in an ersatz homosexual relationship.\n\nThen why didn't you say that to her?\n\nWhy is it always my responsibility?\n\nIt's not always your responsibility.\n\nI swear, this is the same thing you did at the comic book store last week.\n\nI can't believe you're bringing that up.\n\nI didn't bring it up. You did.\n\nWe'll talk about this later.\n\nYou always say that, but you never do.\n\nYou went to the comic book store without me?\n\nYou got alcohol?\n\nYour mom still here?\n\nCome on in.\n\nWait, she's not gonna come here looking for you, is she?\n\nRelax. She took Sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan.\n\nOh, my God. What happened?\n\nNothing.\n\nMother likes looking at brains and Sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.\n\nGeez, what a fun couple.\n\nShe's only been here a day and a half and I'm seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path.\n\nI talked to her for 5 minutes yesterday and I've been half bombed ever since.\n\nYou can't let her get into your head.\n\nMy head, what about yours?\n\nIt's too late for me.\n\nMy head is her summer house.\n\nShe was right.\n\nThe locus of my identity is totally exterior to me.\n\nYeah, there she is. Hi, Mom.\n\nDo you know where I was all morning?\n\nAuditioning with 50 other blondes for some stupid antidepressant commercial.\n\nAnd for what?\n\nSo I'll finally get my daddy's approval?\n\nDid you get the part?\n\nNo, they said I was too perky.\n\nYou want to talk about not getting love from a parent.\n\nYou know what I used to do when I was little to have some sensation of human contact?\n\nYeah, you grabbed your penis and wouldn't let go.\n\nYour mother told me.\n\nOf course she did.\n\nThat's not what I was gonna say.\n\nWhen I was ten years old,\n\nI built a hugging machine.\n\nA hugging machine?\n\nI got a dressmaker's mannequin,\n\nI stuffed it with an electric blanket so it would be warm, and built two radio-controlled arms that would hug me and pat my back.\n\nThat is so sad.\n\nYou know what the saddest part was?\n\nMy father used to borrow it.\n\nYour scan data will be very helpful to my research.\n\nYou have a remarkable brain.\n\nI know.\n\nAlthough I've always hated how my right frontal lobe looks in pictures.\n\nCommon complaint among men.\n\nNothing's ever big enough.\n\nExcept when they get a tumor.\n\nThen you never hear the end of it.\n\nI'd love to see a scan of your brain sometime.\n\nI'll send you a link, but its physiology is fairly unimpressive.\n\nI can't believe that.\n\nYour unwillingness to accept empirical evidence suggests an attempt at flattery.\n\nMy apologies.\n\nI've been living with your son too long.\n\nGotten into some bad habits.\n\nUnderstandable.\n\nCan I make you a cup of tea?\n\nI doubt it, but if anyone has a chance, it's probably you.\n\nI feel very comfortable around you.\n\nI feel very comfortable around you, too.\n\nIt's surprising because I generally don't feel comfortable around... well, anyone.\n\nNor I.\n\nWhat are the odds that two individuals as unique as ourselves would be connected by someone as comparatively workaday as your son?\n\nIs that a rhetorical point or would you like to do the math?\n\nI'd like to do the math.\n\nI'd like that, too.\n\nNow this time, you're gonna lick the salt... off my neck... do the shot... and then... bite the lime.\n\nI'm sorry, I didn't hear anything after \"lick.\"\n\nNeck, shot, lime.\n\nShot, lime.\n\nRight.\n\nWhere's the lime?\n\nWe're sharing.\n\nSo, what do you think?\n\nI'm very tempted.\n\nI'm just not sure it's appropriate with my son's roommate.\n\nNormally, I'd feel the same way.\n\nBut based on everything\n\nI've observed about us,\n\nI can't help but speculate we'd be very good together.\n\nTrue. I've had a similar observation.\n\nIt's certainly something\n\nI could never do with my husband.\n\nI was hesitant the first time I tried it, but I experienced an unanticipated and remarkable release of endorphins.\n\nIt's quite satisfying.\n\nI see what you're doing.\n\nYou're appealing to the neuroscientific researcher in me.\n\nYou see right through me, don't you?\n\nOnly when you're in a CAT scanner.\n\nThis is actually gonna happen.\n\nHoney, shush, shush.\n\nYou shush, I'm happy.\n\nI want to talk about it.\n\nYou know what my mother would say?\n\nShe would say because you weren't loved by your father and I was not loved by my mother, that having sex is our way of making up for the intimacy we didn't get as children.\n\nWhy would you bring that up right now?\n\nI don't know.\n\nForeplay?\n\nSo you're saying you're not having sex with me, you're having sex with your mother?\n\nI'm gonna go with \"no.\"\n\nThat is the sickest thing\n\nI've ever heard.\n\nCome on, you're trying to have sex with your father and I'm okay with that.\n\nGet out!\n\nShe said shush.\n\nI should have shushed.\n\nAll right, Mother.\n\nHave a nice flight.\n\nThat's not really in my control, is it?\n\nGood morning.\n\nMorning.\n\nI was just coming over to talk to you.\n\nYou don't have to.\n\nEver.\n\nGotcha.\n\nGood-bye, Mother.\n\nGood-bye.\n\nSo, Slugger, shall we pick up where we left off last time?\n\nI mean, my mom could've just said, \"Bob, get over it, she's a girl, move on.\"\n\nBut she didn't. Not one word.\n\nInteresting.\n\nWould you be willing to fly to New Jersey and discuss your relationship with your parents during a brain scan?\n\nWould it help?\n\nWell, it would help me.\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "f914c790-358e-4e06-9ff6-8b905c7ad343": {"__data__": {"id_": "f914c790-358e-4e06-9ff6-8b905c7ad343", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "7b47a97eea43b090978222d7e80c8c8484ed2e19d0a5663b788bebc5ac4cc73e", "text": "\n\nThat was close.\n\nGod, I love the smell of paintballs in the morning.\n\nYeah, still funny.\n\nWe can't get to the ridge.\n\nThe Chemistry Department has us completely cut off.\n\nAnd the creek bed?\n\nThe Pharmacology Department controls that, and they're all hopped up on experimental steroids.\n\nThat's it then.\n\nWe're doomed.\n\nThe time has come to acknowledge that we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my Physics Department paintball strategy meeting.\n\nI told you my mom has spider veins.\n\nI had to take her to the laser clinic.\n\nAnd I told you I wanted to see a doctor's note.\n\nWe need a plan.\n\nHow about\n\nOperation Hammer of the Gods?\n\nWhich one is Hammer of the Gods?\n\nWe hide behind the dumpsters in the parking lot and ambush people when they come to pee.\n\nNo go.

Problem solved.\n\nNobody cares where you're going to sit.\n\nYou're not crazy.\n\nExcuse me, but the problem is not solved.\n\nIf your head had been accidentally amputated, and we transplanted a dog's head in its place, would that be \"problem solved\"?\n\nIf it were your head, it would be.\n\nI am really, really sorry, but it's only for a week.\n\nCan't you be a little bit flexible?\n\nYeah, sorry.\n\nI didn't really think that through.\n\nYou claimed it's going to be a week, but I have no faith in your dry cleaner.\n\nWhy not?\n\nDid you notice the sign on his counter?\n\nHe's not a full-time dry cleaner.\n\nHe also makes keys.\n\nFor God's sake, Sheldon.\n\nFocus is important.\n\nWas Michael DeBakey a wedding planner in between heart transplants?\n\nDid Alexander Fleming moonlight as a hairdresser? \"Thanks for discovering penicillin.\n\nNow how about we try a bouffant?\"\n\nLooks like I'm gonna have sex tonight.\n\nHey, baby.\n\nHis right hand is calling him?\n\nNo, it's Leslie Winkle.\n\nIt's a long story.\n\nI'll pick you up in ten minutes.\n\nGentlemen, <i>adieu</i>.\n\nI thought we were going to play Halo tonight.\n\nWhat am I supposed to do?\n\nThere's a woman out there anxious to have sex with me.\n\nYou understand, right?\n\nNo. Not at all.\n\nNevertheless, I must depart.\n\nBy the way, did I tell you?\n\nLeslie pulled some strings and got me on the research trip to Geneva to check out the CERN Supercollider.\n\nThat's not fair.\n\nYou're not even a physicist.\n\nThere are two ways of looking at this...\n\nGet out.\n\nBye.\n\nYou're improving.\n\nThank you.\n\nIt helps when I get to practice with a real woman.\n\nListen.\n\nSaturday my sister's getting married.\n\nI want you to come with me.\n\nIt's black tie.\n\nYeah, gee...\n\nI'd really rather not.\n\nWhy not?\n\nWhen I go to weddings, it's to scam on chunky bridesmaids.\n\nI don't know what I would do with a date.\n\nAll right. I understand.\n\nThanks.\n\nI'm really sorry about that Geneva trip.\n\nWhat about it?\n\nDidn't you hear?\n\nI reduced the number of people going, and you didn't make the cut.\n\nWhen did that happen?\n\nAbout 12 seconds ago.\n\nWell, hold on.\n\nAre you... saying if I don't go to the wedding,\n\nI can't go to Geneva?\n\nActually, I'm trying not to say it.\n\nOkay, I'm sorry, but that makes me a little uncomfortable.\n\nHow so? 'Cause it's like you're controlling me with new equipment and research trips.\n\nIf I weren't controlling you with new equipment and research trips, then I'd be uncomfortable.\n\nHow so? 'Cause we'd be in a real relationship with feelings and all that crap.\n\nSo, bottom line, I'm just a... bought-and-paid-for sex toy.\n\nNo, not at all.\n\nYou're also arm candy.\n\nSo?\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nHey, Ma, you got to rent me a tux! are you having up there?</i>\n\nWhy are you crouching there?\n\nThis is my spot.\n\nWhere else am I supposed to crouch?\n\nI don't know. Texas?\n\nHere you go. Fresh from the cleaners, good as new.\n\nReally? Great.\n\nSheldon, look. Good as new.\n\nFrom that key maker,\n\nI highly doubt it.\n\nCome on, Sheldon.\n\nJust give it a try.\n\nAll right.\n\nThere, nice and comfy cozy.\n\nZero, zero, zero.\n\nThere's one more zero.\n\nYou forgot the time parameter.\n\nSit on the damn couch.\n\nWhat do you mean, \"nope\"?\n\nWhat's wrong with it?\n\nNothing, it's what's wrong with him.\n\nIt's exactly the same...\n\nPenny, I think I know what to do.\n\nSheldon, I have some bad news.\n\nMore?\n\nI'm afraid so.\n\nYou know the cashew chicken\n\nI get you Monday nights?\n\nYes. From Szechuan Palace.\n\nSzechuan Palace closed two years ago.\n\nWhat?\n\nWhere did my cashew chicken come from?\n\nGolden Dragon.\n\nNo, this isn't right.\n\nOur food always comes in Szechuan Palace containers.\n\nYeah, well, before they went out of business,\n\nI bought 4,000 containers.\n\nI keep them in the trunk of my car.\n\nBut...\n\nThis changes everything.\n\nI thought that might take his mind off the cushion.\n\nWhat's real? What isn't?\n\nHow can I know?\n\nYou did make that up, right?\n\nOh, God, I wish I had.\n\nLeonard?\n\nYeah, buddy?\n\nI still don't like this cushion.\n\nOkay, first of all,\n\nPenny, thank you for coming.\n\nThanks for the shoes.\n\nPenny is an amazing shot.\n\nWe have a real chance to win this week.\n\nWhat's the plan?\n\nNow, we all run out.\n\nSheldon and I will cut to the left behind these trees.\n\nRaj, Howard and Leslie flank to the right behind the rocks.\n\nWe'll have a great view as Penny runs out and kills everyone else in sight.\n\nJust one thing before we start.\n\nWhat is it, Sheldon?\n\nWhat the hell?!\n\nThat was for my cushion.\n\nSheldon, Penny was our only hope.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nBut revenge is a dish best served cold.\n\nScrew that.\n\nShe can't shoot me.\n\nShe's dead.\n\nHe's right. You can't.\n\nWell, if we're going to descend into anarchy...\n\nSee you.\n\nWhere are you going?\n\nSurrender, then Denny's.\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "9fa65765-3df5-4321-8950-03caadc0161b": {"__data__": {"id_": "9fa65765-3df5-4321-8950-03caadc0161b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "c7a4c9ec7084c9149c5c0d157e538a0bb1d20f54a3fc84d5b060f24b4f7179cd", "text": "\n\nOkay, Raj.\n\nHand me the #6 Torx screwdriver.\n\nStop.\n\nWe can't do this.\n\nIt's not right.\n\nYou have two choices.

You want to come?\n\nI always enjoy that, but I'm a little busy.\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\nI'm simplifying the task of packing for our trip.\n\nSee, by attaching RFID tags to my clothing, it will enable my laptop to read and identify the items with this wand.\n\nI will then cross-reference them against destination, anticipated activity spectrum, weather conditions, duration of trip, et cetera.\n\nThat does sound much simpler.\n\nHow long is this going to take?\n\nAssuming I can keep up this pace, three hours, 11 minutes.\n\nPlus however long it takes to conclude this fairly pointless conversation.\n\nTeasing the guys at the Apple store seems a little redundant now.\n\nI don't follow.\n\nI wouldn't expect you to. See you.\n\nSocks: one pair, cotton, argyle, blue.\n\nSocks: one pair, cotton, argyle, blue.\n\nWhat on earth are you doing?\n\nWhatever it is,\n\nI'm guessing we're doing it wrong.\n\nGentlemen, this is the Coast Starlight, one of the great American trains operating on one of the classic\n\nAmerican routes.\n\nOn this side, you'll see panoramic ocean vistas inaccessible to any other form of transportation, while on your side, you'll be treated to 350 miles of CostCos, Jiffy Lubes, and cinderblock homes with above-ground pools.\n\nCome on, Raj.\n\nWhat's wrong with Jiffy Lubes?\n\nWhy not?\n\nThat's over the wheelbase.\n\nAre you completely unfamiliar with the suspension characteristics of a pre-1980\n\nPullman-built Superliner Deluxe passenger coach?\n\nWe've been on this train 90 seconds, and you've already said a thousand words.\n\nJust tell us where to sit and shut up.\n\nHere.\n\nI'm hoping once you reap the endorphic rewards of the steady clickety-clack of steel wheels on polished rails, your sour disposition will abate.\n\nYeah, maybe.\n\nMeanwhile, back in the 21st century, people are raising their tray tables and putting their seat-backs in an upright position 'cause it's time to land in San Francisco.\n\nIt's not so bad, really. At least these trains have modern plumbing.\n\nIn India, you squat over a hole in the train and expose your naked buttocks to the chilly air of Rajasthan.\n\nHe is referring, of course, to third class on Indian Railways' magnificent Ranakpur Express and its 1,200-kilometer journey from Maharashtra to the Bikaner Junction.\n\nOh, look, now he's boring on an international scale.\n\nHoly crap! Look!\n\nIs that who I think it is?\n\nIt can't be.\n\nWhat would Summer Glau be doing riding the train?\n\nMaybe John Connor's aboard and she's protecting him from an evil Terminator.\n\nUnlikely. That's a television show.\n\nThank you.\n\nOf course, if SkyNet actually did exist in the future, a perfect way to infiltrate and destroy mankind would be to send\n\nTerminators back posing as actors who have played Terminators in popular films and television series, lulling us into a false sense of security, i.e., \"That's Summer Glau from <i>The Sarah Connor Chronicles</i>. \"No, Summer, don't kill me!\n\nI'm pro-robot!\"\n\nAt least he's off the train crap.\n\nI owe you an apology. Taking the train was a stroke of brilliance!\n\nI've actually got a shot at a Terminator.\n\nPlease.\n\nWhen it comes to Terminators, you've got a better shot of scoring with Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nYou're overlooking something.\n\nI have 11 hours with her in a confined space.\n\nUnless she's willing to jump off a moving train, tuck and roll down the side of a hill, she will eventually succumb to the acquired taste that is Howard Wolowitz.\n\nMy money's on tuck and roll.\n\nI'm confused.\n\nI thought you were involved in some sort of socially intimate pairing with Leslie Winkle.\n\nLet me explain to you how this works.\n\nAll right.\n\nThat's Summer Glau.\n\nThat's it.\n\nHang on a sec.\n\nWhy do you get first crack at her?\n\nLet's see, couple reasons.\n\nOne, I saw her first.\n\nNo, you didn't. I did.\n\nFair enough.\n\nBut... then, let me move on to #2.\n\nUnlike you, I can actually talk to women when I'm sober.\n\nYou fail to take into account that even mute,\n\nI am foreign and exotic, while you, on the other hand, are frail and pasty.\n\nYou know the old saying, \"Pasty and frail never fail.\"\n\nExcuse me, but what about me?\n\nWhy don't I get a shot?\n\nFine, go ahead.\n\nTake a shot.\n\nI've already got a gorgeous blonde back home that I can't score with.\n\nI think I'll let you two take this one.\n\nIs there a place on this train to get alcohol?\n\nInteresting that you ask.\n\nThe Coast Starlight recently added the refurbished Pacific Parlour Car.\n\nBuilt in 1956 and originally known as the Santa Fe Lounge Car, the lower level is a theater and the upper level is a bar that offers wine tastings if you're going as far as Portland.\n\nSo aren't you going to go talk to her?\n\nI will, I'm just working on my opening line.\n\nShe's probably heard every possible line.\n\nWhy don't you just try \"hello\"?\n\nNo, no, that always creeps girls out.\n\nI need to come up with something that's funny, smart and delicately suggests that my sexual endowment is disproportionate to my physical stature.\n\nYou're going to need more than 11 hours.\n\nOh, no.\n\nWhat's the matter?\n\nI forgot my flash drive.\n\nSo?\n\nSo we have to go back.\n\nOkay, I'm going to say \"why\" and your answer cannot be \"because I forgot my flash drive.\"\n\nYou don't understand.\n\nMy flash drive has my paper on astrophysical probes of M-theory effects in the early universe that I was going to give to George Smoot at the conference.\n\nWhy do you have to give your paper to George Smoot?\n\nIt's brilliant.\n\nHe needs to read it.\n\nSo you'll send him an e-mail when we get back.\n\nThen I won't get to see his face light up as he reads it.\n\nRight. Of course.\n\nThis is an unmitigated disaster.\n\nThere's nothing you can do about it, so relax.\n\nSit back, enjoy the clickety-clack of the steel wheels on the polished rails.\n\nYou forgot your flash drive, you forgot your flash drive...\n\nOnly ten hours, 55 minutes to go.\n\nIt's hot in here. Must be Summer.\n\nSo... where you gals headed?\n\nOkay, I've found the perfect solution.\n\nWe get off the train at the next stop in Oxnard.\n\nWe then take the 1:13 train back to Union Station.\n\nWe take a cab back to the apartment, get my flash drive, and then race to San Luis Obispo, where, assuming the lights are with us and minimal traffic, we'll meet the train.\n\nI've got a better idea.\n\nAre you going to be sarcastic?\n\nYou take all the fun out of it for me.\n\nPenny's home. Why don't we call her, have her go in the apartment, get your flash drive and e-mail you the paper?\n\nBut the flash drive is in a locked drawer in my desk.\n\nSo?\n\nThe key is hidden in my room.\n\nSo?\n\nPenny would have to go into my room.\n\nSo?\n\nPeople don't go in my room!\n\nI see. It seems once again, you're caught between a rock and a crazy place.\n\nI hate when that happens.\n\nIt's hot in here. Must be Summer.\n\nIt's hot in here. Must be Summer.\n\nIt's hot in here. Must be Summer.\n\nThat's cute.\n\nReally? I just made it up.\n\nHave you seen <i>Slumdog Millionaire</i>?\n\nYeah, I loved it.\n\nIt's loosely based on my life.\n\nWe're putting the play on for one night in this little 99-seat theater.\n\nCan you come?\n\nOh, great.\n\nDo you know 98 other people that might want to come?\n\nHang on.\n\nListen carefully.\n\nI'm about to give you a set of instructions which you must follow to the letter.\n\nJust a sec.\n\nThe theater is above a bowling alley, so it's a little noisy, but it might be the only chance\n\nI'll ever get to play Anne Frank.\n\nAnd the director is brilliant.\n\nHe uses the bowling sounds as, like, Nazi artillery.\n\nGreat, I'll see you then.\n\nHello?\n\nDo you see that small plastic case on my dresser?\n\nYour dresser? Who is this?\n\nIt's Sheldon.\n\nHow is San Francisco?\n\nI'm not in San Francisco.\n\nI'm on a train.\n\nWere you even listening to me?\n\nI was talking to my friend, but what's up?\n\nWhat's up? I'll tell you what's up.\n\nI'm in a crisis situation, and I need you to marshal your powers of concentration, limited as they may be...\n\nGive me the phone.\n\nHi, Penny. It's Leonard.\n\nWhat's going on with Dr. Wackadoodle?\n\nHe's calling to ask you a favor.\n\nYou might be confused because he didn't use the words, \"Penny,\" \"Sheldon,\" \"please\" or \"favor.\"\n\nEnough chitchat.\n\nOkay, step one.\n\nLocate your emergency key to our apartment. enter our apartment.\n\nStep three:...\n\nEnter my bedroom.\n\nHang on, getting another call.\n\nLet me tell you.\n\nPersonal robots cannot get here soon enough.\n\nAnd that bright little star peeking her head out early today... that's Venus.\n\nThat is so cool.\n\nYou really know a lot about space.\n\nCome on.\n\nWhen you were on TV in <i>Firefly</i>, you were actually in space.\n\nYou're not one of those guys who really believe that, are you?\n\nYou mean one of the hopeless geeks?\n\nThose are crazy people.\n\nHoward, be a dear and get me another one of these.\n\nNow, him, he's one of those geeks.\n\nAll right, now, before you enter my bedroom unescorted,\n\nI need you to understand that this onetime grant of access does not create a permanent easement.\n\nEasement.\n\nIt's a legal right of access.\n\nGood grief.\n\nWhat? No, don't put me on hold.\n\nDo you believe him?\n\nNormally around women, he has the personality of a boiled potato.\n\nPut one beer in him, and he's M. Night Charmalarmalon.\n\nIs that what he's drinking?\n\nIt's not even real beer.\n\nWhat?\n\nLook. \"Non-alcoholic beer.\"\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nI don't know.\n\nSome sort of placebo effect,\n\nI guess.\n\nPlacebo, you say.\n\nInteresting.\n\nYes, I'm still here.\n\nWhere am I going? I'm on a train.\n\nNow, what you'll be looking for is a small wooden box located between a Hoberman's sphere and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite.\n\nHoberman's Sphere.\n\nIt's a collapsible icosidodecahedron.\n\nNo, the thing with the time on it is my alarm clock.\n\nActually, in India, the names of constellations are different.\n\nWhere you have the Big Dipper, we have the Big Curry Pot.\n\nYou're making that up.\n\nYou got me.\n\nNow what are you going to do with me?\n\nLook.\n\nWhat am I looking at?\n\nYou tell me. \"Non-alcoholic beer.\"\n\nHi. I'm the small package good things come in.\n\nI got a box, but there's no key in here.\n\nJust letters.\n\nThat's the wrong box. Put it back.\n\nAre these letters from your grandmother?\n\nDon't read those letters!\n\nLook, she calls you \"Moon Pie.\"\n\nThat is so cute.\n\nPut down the letters!\n\nHey, Penny. It's Leonard.\n\nHow's the train ride?\n\nDelightful.\n\nI don't know what you're doing but there are little bubbles forming on the corners of Sheldon's mouth.\n\nYeah, I kind of crossed a line.\n\nPut him back on.\n\nThank you.\n\nI'm back.\n\nWhat up, Moon Pie?\n\nNo one calls me Moon Pie but Meemaw!\n\nHey, Penny. Leonard again.\n\nIn the dream, you and I were ice skating, just the two of us.\n\nAnd then, I picked you up by your ankles and twirled you round and round until your legs tore off.\n\nI tried to stick them back on, but before I could, you turned into a giant loaf of pumpernickel bread.\n\nWhat do you think that means?\n\nI really don't know.\n\nI'll give you a clue.\n\nMy favorite sandwich?\n\nSalami on pumpernickel.\n\nIs that so?\n\nDid you know \"pumpernickel\" comes from the German words \"pumper\" and \"nickel,\" which loosely translates to \"fart goblin\"?\n\nI didn't.\n\nOkay, I found the box. Now what?\n\nYou're holding a Japanese puzzle box, which takes ten precise moves to open. with the diamond pattern</i> and slide the center portion one millimeter to the left. of the box,</i> slide the entire panel down two millimeters.\n\nYou'll hear a slight click.\n\nHang on.\n\nDo you have any emotional attachment to this box?\n\nNo, it's a novelty\n\nI ordered off the Internet.\n\nDid you hear the click?\n\nNot yet.\n\nThere it is.\n\nOkay, here's another one.\n\nIf you married the famous rock guitarist Johnny Winter, you'd be Summer Winter.\n\nI'm going to just go for broke here and say I like you.\n\nSo here's my question: do you realistically see any conversational path that would take us from where we are right now to a place where I could ask you out and you'd say yes?\n\nFair enough.\n\nI'll leave you in peace.\n\nThank you.\n\nBut before I go, would you mind if I take one picture of us together for my Facebook page?\n\nSure.\n\nGreat. Now, can I take one where it looks like we're making out?\n\nNow you're going to insert the flash drive into the USB port...\n\nShe calls me Moon Pie because I'm nummy-nummy and she could just eat me up.\n\nNow, please put the flash drive in the USB port.\n\nThe one that looks like a little duck's mouth.\n\nHow'd it go?\n\nTerminator broke my phone.\n\nExcuse me.\n\nI'll be honest with you.\n\nI've just spent the last two hours imaging various scenarios in my head, trying to come up with some clever line to say to you.\n\nBut I finally realized you're a human being;\n\nI'm a human being.\n\nI could just say...\n\nI'm sorry. This is me.\n\nHi, my name's Leonard.\n\nSo, I'm thinking, you won the Nobel Prize what, three years ago?\n\nSo you must deal with a whole lot of \"What has Smoot done lately?\"\n\nMy thought is we continue my research as a team... you know, Cooper-Smoot, alphabetical... and when we win the Nobel Prize, you'll be back on top.\n\nWith all due respect, Dr. Cooper, are you on crack?\n\nFine!\n\nSmoot-Cooper.\n\nWhat a diva.\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "241cc5d6-a183-47c0-b2ea-d8896de57b90": {"__data__": {"id_": "241cc5d6-a183-47c0-b2ea-d8896de57b90", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "66248ccc674cc5481bf93699f7f1db833f266b26a2f896de593989d9fee30654", "text": "\n\nKnight to queen's bishop-five.\n\nVery nice.\n\nWhat's Leonard going to do?\n\nGive up the pawn or give up the position?\n\nLet's find out.\n\nReady?\n\nReady.\n\nGo.\n\nDamn it. I slipped.\n\nToo bad. You know the rules of Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Chess.\n\nLeonard died again,\n\nSheldon. You're up.\n\nDespite my deep love of chess, lasers and aerosol disinfectant,\n\nI must forfeit.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause it's almost 11:00.\n\nSo?\n\nPenny has a \"don't knock on my door before 11:00 or I punch you in the throat\" rule.\n\nYou know what'd be a great idea?\n\nWe get some girls over here and play Laser Optical Strip Chess.\n\nBelieve me, any girl who would be willing to play that, you don't want to see naked.\n\nYou underestimate me.\n\nHey, Sheldon.\n\nIt's 11:00 a.m.\n\nI know. You're safe.\n\nThis package came while you were at work.\n\nGreat, my rhinestones.\n\nThank you.\n\nExcuse me.\n\nWhat?\n\nYou have to sign this.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nWhen I signed for the package,\n\nI was deputized by the United Parcel Service and entrusted with its final delivery.\n\nI now need you to acknowledge receipt of the package so that I'm fully indemnified and no longer liable.\n\nIt's just a box of rhinestones.\n\nThe contents are irrelevant.\n\nA legal bailment has been created.\n\nDoes that mean nothing to you?\n\nIt means nothing to anybody.\n\nLet me show you what I'm doing. \"Bailment\" describes a relationship in common law where a physical possession of personal property, or \"chattels,\" is transferred from one person, the bailor, to another person, the bailee...\n\nLook, look!\n\nI started a business.\n\nObviously, not a cleaning business.\n\nNo, I'm making flower barrettes.\n\nSee?\n\nI call them Penny Blossoms.\n\nI made one for myself, then all the girls at work wanted one.\n\nI showed some to this lady who runs a shop in Old Town.\n\nShe sells cards and homemade jewelry.\n\nShe said she wanted to sell them.\n\nI said, \"Okay.\"\n\nAnd in one week, I made a $156.\n\nGood for you.

What does he like?\n\nI don't know, he's 13.\n\nJust pick out anything. \"Just pick out anything\"?\n\nMaybe we can pick out a new suit for him without knowing his size.\n\nOr pick out his career for him without knowing his aptitude.\n\nOr pick out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fiber requirements.\n\nOr his feelings about little marshmallows.\n\nSpider-Man.

She's with us.\n\nGuys like that are so pathetic.\n\nTell me about it.\n\nLook, a new Batman belt buckle.\n\nHey, Leonard.\n\nCan I help you find something?\n\nHey, Stuart. This is Penny.\n\nShe's looking for some comic books.\n\nOh, really.\n\nBlink twice if you're here against your will.\n\nI think we're fine, Stuart.\n\nLet me know if you need anything.\n\nThanks.\n\nHe seems like a nice guy.\n\nYou mean for someone who's into comic books?\n\nI just meant for... yeah.\n\nJust because people appreciate comic books doesn't make them weirdos.\n\nStuart's a terrific artist.\n\nHe went to the Rhode Island\n\nSchool of Design.\n\nWhat about the guy over there in the superhero T-shirt tucked into his sweatpants?\n\nYeah, that's Captain Sweatpants.\n\nHe doesn't really help the point I'm trying to make.\n\nGot it.

What would you recommend as a present for a 13-year-old boy?\n\nA 13-year-old girl.\n\nBut if you're dead set on a comic book, try... this.\n\nWhat's this about?\n\nA morally ambiguous confidence man who smokes, has lung cancer and is tormented by the spirits of the undead.\n\nIf it doesn't make me the favorite aunt,\n\nI don't know what will.\n\nIs this me?\n\nDepends. Do you like it?\n\nIt's really good.\n\nYes, that's you.\n\nThat's so sweet, but what if I didn't like it?\n\nIt'd still be you, but I'd feel like an idiot.\n\nI don't believe it.\n\nStuart's putting the moves on Penny.\n\nI have got to learn how to draw.\n\nOnce again, defeated by your own prurient interests.\n\nGuys, have you seen Stuart all up in Penny's business over there?\n\nNobody's up in anybody's business.\n\nLet's just buy our stuff and go.\n\nOkay, you've got my number.\n\nNow, give me the picture.\n\nYou drive a hard bargain.\n\nBut here.\n\nAll right.\n\nSo, just give me a call.\n\nSo, Leonard, how are you enjoying\n\nAnything Can Happen Thursday?\n\nLook at that.\n\nThat's a dent.\n\nThank you,\n\nHoward \"Ham-Fisted\" Wolowitz.\n\nDid you just shut the TV off in the middle of the classic\n\nDeep Space Nine/Star Trek:\n\nThe Original Series \"Trouble With Tribbles\" crossover episode?\n\nApparently so.\n\nAre you ill?\n\nAll right.\n\nThen is it fair to say that you're experiencing some sort of emotional turmoil over the events involving Penny earlier this evening?\n\nWhen did you pick up on that?\n\nA moment ago, when you turned off the TV during the classic\n\nThe Original Series</i> \"Trouble With Tribbles\" crossover episode.\n\nWould you like some advice?\n\nSure, why not?\n\nThen, this is the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comments section.\n\nThanks a lot.\n\nWould you rather I offer my personal insight?\n\nI don't need any insights.\n\nI just want to know why Penny's more interested in Stuart than me.\n\nWe're practically the same guy.\n\nI disagree.\n\nStuart is taller, artistic, self-employed and, most significantly, he gets 45 percent off comic books.\n\nYou're right. I really should be asking strangers on the Internet.\n\nMy original point.\n\nChinese food, vintage video games...\n\nAfter the nightmare of\n\nAnything Can Happen Thursday, this is Friday night the way it was meant to be.\n\nWho's up for Sheldon-Free Saturday?\n\nHey, Penny... and Stuart.\n\nHey, guys.\n\nSo what are you kids up to?\n\nStuart has a piece in an art show that's opening tonight.\n\nAnd you guys are going together.\n\nGreat...\n\nIt is great.\n\nReally great.\n\nFreaking awesome.\n\nWhat are you guys doing?\n\nIt's Friday night,\n\nChinese food and vintage video games, right?\n\nVintage doesn't even begin to describe what we have planned.\n\nTonight, we are playing the classic 1980 interactive text adventure, Zork.\n\nIt's the buggy beta version.\n\nZork. Well, you guys have fun.\n\nSee you guys.\n\nSee you, Stuart.\n\nHey, Howard?\n\nTake me to a bar with women.\n\nReally?\n\nYeah.\n\nLet me just go inside and slip off my underwear.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, if I get lucky, I don't want to be caught in my Aquaman briefs.\n\nDo you...? Let's go.\n\nMay I have a grasshopper with a little umbrella, please?\n\nNo, he may not.\n\nWhy?\n\nI'm not sitting here with a guy drinking a grasshopper with a little umbrella.\n\nFine. I'll have a chocolate martini.\n\nWrong again!\n\nYou know I can't talk to women unless I'm lit up like the Hindu festival of Devali.\n\nThere are plenty of bars in Los Angeles where you can order grasshoppers and chocolate martinis, but you wouldn't have to because there are no women in them.\n\nGotcha.\n\nI'll have a Brandy Alexander.\n\nAll right, the Three Musketeers just became the Dynamic Duo.\n\nShould we talk to some of these women?\n\nIt's way too early in the night for that.\n\nFirst we let the lawyers and the jocks thin the herd, and then... we go after the weak and the old and the lame.\n\nThat's your system?\n\nThat's my system.\n\nAnd if you spot a chick with a Seeing Eye dog, she's mine.\n\nCome on. I think it's nice that Captain Sweatpants showed up to your art opening.\n\nYeah, it would have been nicer if he hadn't touched all the cheese.\n\nYou know, it's kind of early.\n\nDo you want to maybe come in for some coffee?\n\nGee, it's a little late for coffee, isn't it?\n\nYou think \"coffee,\" means coffee.\n\nThat is so sweet.\n\nCome on. I think I have decaf.\n\nGood, Stuart.\n\nI thought I heard your voice.\n\nDo you have a moment?\n\nYeah, I guess.\n\nSheldon, we're a little busy, so...\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\nWe're having coffee.\n\nIsn't it a little late for coffee?\n\nIt's okay. She thinks she has decaf.\n\nI'll just go look for it.\n\nWhat's up?\n\nI've spent the last three hours in an online debate in the DC Comics Batman chatroom, and I need your help.\n\nYeah. Those guys can be very stubborn.\n\nWhat's the topic?\n\nI am asserting, in the event that Batman's death proves permanent, the original Robin, Dick Grayson, is the logical successor to the Bat Cowl.\n\nSheldon, I'm afraid you couldn't be more wrong.\n\nMore wrong?\n\nWrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation.\n\nOf course it is. It's a little wrong to say a tomato is a vegetable.\n\nIt's very wrong to say it's a suspension bridge.\n\nBut returning to the original issue,\n\nDick Grayson became Nightwing, a superhero in his own right.\n\nBatman 2 has to be the second Robin, Jason Todd.\n\nHas to be? Has to be?\n\nI hope you're being deliberately provocative.\n\nI found the decaf!\n\nGreat!\n\nHerbal tea for me, please.\n\nBarkeep!\n\nAlexander me.\n\nHow about those two?\n\nThey're eating peanuts.\n\nAnd my allergies, one kiss would put me in Cedars-Sinai for a week.\n\nWhat about the ones in the corner?\n\nPossible. Very possible.\n\nYou want the one in the whiplash collar or the one who keeps blinking?\n\nI think Blinky's cute.\n\nYou got it, sir.\n\nWait, so we just go over there?\n\nWe have a little prep work to do.\n\nPut this in your mouth.\n\nWe walk past them, you stumble a bit.\n\nI say, sorry, my friend's had a little too much.\n\nAnd then I start to pull it out of your mouth.\n\nAnd say, \"A little too much fun.\"\n\nGet it?\n\nThey're laughing, we're laughing.\n\nThen we get them up to about a .15 blood alcohol level, and tell them we're millionaires.\n\nWhat else you got?\n\nDepends. Are you willing to sit on my lap and pretend to be a ventriloquist dummy?\n\nI can't sit on your lap.\n\nYou don't know the routine.\n\nI'm sorry, but you're obviously stuck in a pre-<i>Zero Hour</i> DC universe.\n\nOf course I am.\n\nRemoving Joe Chill as the killer of Batman's parents effectively deprived him of his <i>raison d'tre</i>.\n\nThrow all the French around you want, it doesn't make you right.\n\nPlus, you're forgetting that the <i>Infinite Crisis</i> storyline restored Joe Chill to the Batman mythology.\n\nI am forgetting nothing and I resent your tone.\n\nLook, Sheldon, it's late.\n\nI've got to get some sleep.\n\nSo, I win.\n\nNo, I'm tired.\n\nSo, I win.\n\nFine. You win.\n\nDarn tootin', I win.\n\nPenny, I really had a terrific time...\n\nNo, don't wake her.\n\nShe'll maul you like a rabid wolverine.\n\nYou know, I don't think that was decaf.\n\nWait. Is this your card or isn't it?\n\nTrust me. This was their card.\n\nI thought you were good at this.\n\nYou're always talking about how you go to bars and meet women.\n\nI do, all the time.\n\nWell, what happened?\n\nWe've been sitting here all night and the longest conversation you've had with a woman was when your mom called.\n\nYou're just going to make me come out and say it?\n\nSay what?\n\nYou're weighing me down.\n\nI'm a falcon who hunts better solo.\n\nFine. I'll sit here.\n\nYou take flight and hunt.\n\nDon't be ridiculous.\n\nYou can't tell a falcon when to hunt.\n\nActually, you can.\n\nThere's a whole sport built around it.\n\nFalconry.\n\nShut up.\n\nLet's just get Koothrappali and go.\n\nLucky bastard.\n\nIt's got to be that stupid accent of his.\n\nHello.

Don't move.\n\nJust stay the beautiful, unspoiled\n\nAmerican flower that you are.\n\nWhat's wrong with you, dude?\n\nThat woman was all up in my jammy.\n\nOkay, I hate to break this to you and whatever your \"jammy\" is, but...\n\nI'm pretty sure she's a prostitute.\n\nWhat?\n\nLet me put it this way:\n\nIn your entire life, how many gorgeous women have walked straight up to you in a bar and asked if you wanted to party?\n\nMaybe I can save her.\n\nMaybe, but I'm guessing it'll cost you about $500 an hour to try.\n\nIt was lovely meeting you.\n\nBest of luck in your future endeavors.\n\nWhatever.\n\nI miss her already.\n\nHoward's losing it.\n\nCheck out his latest Twitters. \"I'm at the bottom of a black hole staring into the abyss. \"My life is meaningless.\n\nMy future is without hope.\"\n\nWhy don't we take him to see the Blue Man Group?\n\nYou think that'd help? \"exuberant fun for the whole family.\"\n\nI don't know, Howard isn't really the family fun kind of guy.\n\nIt's too bad he wasn't here for that hooker.\n\nShe's exactly his type; a hooker.\n\nYou know, I bet if we hired her, that would cheer him up.\n\nWe're not gonna get\n\nWolowitz a hooker. \"I'm so lonely and horny, \"I may open this $20 jar of peanuts and end it all.\"\n\nI suppose it wouldn't hurt to get an estimate.\n\nSo how was your day?\n\nAre you trying to make small talk?\n\nSweetie, you really don't have to.\n\nNo, it's the accepted convention.\n\nHow was your day?\n\nThey shifted my schedule around at the restaurant, so my hours are gonna be...\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nThat's not going to interest me at all.\n\nJust eat.\n\nHello again.\n\nHi. Listen...\n\nIf you're not busy, we were thinking maybe you could...\n\nWe were wondering...\n\nIf you're really a prostitute.\n\nYou guys cops?\n\nNo.\n\nI'm a prostitute.\n\nOkay, great.\n\nThe thing is, we've got this friend, and he's kind of down in the dumps.\n\nAnd we thought maybe you could cheer him up.\n\nWith sex.\n\nI think she knows what I meant.\n\nHow when you beat around the bush?\n\nShe's from the mean streets where they shoot from the hip and keep it real.\n\nDon't worry.\n\nI can take good care of your friend.\n\nOkay, terrific.\n\nListen, is there a way that we can do this where he doesn't know that you're a, you know...\n\nProstitute.\n\nYou want the girlfriend experience.\n\nYes. Yeah, exactly.\n\nThe girlfriend experience.\n\nActually, if it's not too much to ask, could we have the Jewish girlfriend experience?\n\nOkay, that's question 20.\n\nYou have to guess.\n\nI don't know, Sheldon.\n\nAre you <i>Star Wars</i>?\n\nHow can one person be a whole movie?\n\nI give up.\n\nCan we just do something else?\n\nFine.\n\nI was Spock.\n\nAre you and Leonard friends with benefits?\n\nWhat?\n\nAre you and Leonard friends with benefits?\n\nWhere did that even come from?\n\nDid he say we were?\n\nNo, Leonard said nothing.\n\nBut who knows what goes on over here when he pretends your mail was misdelivered?\n\nJust mail, no benefits.\n\nI see.\n\nWhy are you asking?\n\nI'm curious about the whole social construct.\n\nOn its face, the idea of satisfying one's sexual appetite, assuming one is afflicted with such, without emotional entanglement, that seems eminently practical.\n\nWhat I've observed, however, is Howard Wolowitz crying like a little girl.\n\nSome people just can't handle that kind of relationship.\n\nCan you?\n\nExcuse me?\n\nAre you able to have sex with men without developing an emotional attachment?\n\nI really... don't want to talk about this with you.\n\nIs this conversation making you uncomfortable?\n\nOf course it's making me uncomfortable.\n\nCan't you tell?\n\nI really have no idea.\n\nI don't particularly excel at reading facial expressions...\n\nI'm uncomfortable, Sheldon!\n\nThank you. That's very helpful.\n\nAll right, where are these amazing shrimp?\n\nBehold.\n\nSeriously, you think this is the size of a baby's arm?\n\nA little baby.\n\nI'm going back to the room.\n\nBoy, would it maybe kill them to put out a nice brisket?\n\nHi, there. Howard Wolowitz.\n\nEsther Rosenblatt.\n\nI don't think the manager's coming tonight, so here.\n\nAre you suggesting\n\nI sleep on the couch?\n\nIt wasn't the first suggestion that came to mind, but it's the one I'm going with.\n\nI can't sleep on your couch.\n\nI sleep in a bed.\n\nAnd given its dimensions, I have no intention of living out Snickering's beloved children's book,\n\nWhat? \"There was a tall man from Cornwall \"whose length exceed his bed. \"My body fits on it, but barely upon it, \"there's no room for my big Cornish head.\"\n\nAll right, I will give you my bed on one condition: that you promise to zip your hole for the next eight hours.\n\nMay I say one last thing?\n\nOnly if it doesn't rhyme.\n\nAll right.\n\nGood night.\n\nTurn-ons? Let me see.\n\nReading a good book in front of the fire, long walks on the beach... and getting freaky on the Sabbath with a bacon cheeseburger.\n\nReally? Me, too!\n\nExcuse me for a moment.\n\nHow's it going?\n\nCut the crap.\n\nYou set this up, didn't you?\n\nShe's a hooker, isn't she?\n\nA prostitute, yes.\n\nYou already gave her the money?\n\nThank you!\n\nWhat?\n\nI can't sleep.\n\nMaybe that's because your hole is still open.\n\nI'm homesick.\n\nYour home is 20 feet from here. it doesn't matter.\n\nIt's in a galaxy far, far away.\n\nDamn it.\n\nWhat do you want me to do?\n\nSing <i>Soft Kitty</i>.\n\nThat's only for when you're sick.\n\nHomesick is a type of being sick.\n\nCome on, do I really have to?\n\nI suppose we can stay up and talk.\n\nSleepy kitty.\n\nStart over.\n\nThank you for letting me stay here.\n\nYou're welcome, sweetie.\n\nOkay, I'm sleepy now.\n\nGet out.\n\nGood. You're finally home.\n\nWhat were you doing at Penny's?\n\nWell, we had dinner, played some games, and then I spent the night.\n\nYou'll be happy to know that I now have a much better understanding of \"friends with benefits.\"\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "f58b3495-a68a-4434-bef2-31e9091ebbb8": {"__data__": {"id_": "f58b3495-a68a-4434-bef2-31e9091ebbb8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "6a7aac4e9e1c37f775c7fb55f0b546dc2e1b08a69b0d4c8ab541dda4dfb07b67", "text": "\n\nSmell that?\n\nThat's the smell of new comic books.\n\nThey're on me today, boys.\n\nYou're paying?\n\nHave you been selling your sperm again?\n\nNo, I'm celebrating.\n\nAs we speak, the space shuttle is docking at the International Space Station where it will deploy the Wolowitz\n\nZero-Gravity Waste Disposal System.\n\nGet over yourself.\n\nIt's a high-tech toilet.\n\nJust think.

You?\n\nFine.\n\nCan I ask you something?\n\nSure.\n\nYou know your friend Stuart?\n\nHe asked me out again and I said yes, and then I started thinking maybe I should talk to you first.\n\nAbout what?\n\nDoes it bother you, me going out with one of your friends? 'Cause you know, you and me...\n\nNo, that's the past.\n\nI'm really more of a \"right now\" kind of guy.\n\nYou know, living in the moment.\n\nAlthough I do have to live a little in the future, 'cause that's my job.\n\nOf course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards, but those stories often take place in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, no, it doesn't bother me.\n\nOkay, well, that's really cool of you.\n\nI wouldn't say cool.\n\nI'd just say... \"That's Leonard!\"\n\nIn that case, do you mind giving me some advice?\n\nAbout Stuart?\n\nLove to.\n\nHe's very shy.\n\nHow do I make him feel more comfortable around me?\n\nFirst of all, don't underestimate the value of discomfort.\n\nReally?\n\nStuart thrives under pressure.\n\nThat's why he works in a comic book store.\n\nIt's Stuart.\n\nYou're not going to answer it?\n\nHe wants to talk about Penny.\n\nI don't want to talk about Penny.\n\nYou're making an assumption.\n\nPerhaps the comic book store is on fire.\n\nAnd he needs your assistance.\n\nWhy would he call me?\n\nWe don't know.\n\nAnd if you don't answer the phone, we can't know.\n\nI'm not answering the phone.\n\nAnswer the phone, Leonard.\n\nThere, it went to voice mail.\n\nAren't you going to check your messages?\n\nYou have to check your messages!\n\nThe living of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message.\n\nIf that contract breaks down, then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy.\n\nIt must be hell inside your head.\n\nAt times.\n\nGuys, we have a code red. \"Code Red\" the hospital emergency alert, the computer worm, or the cherry-flavored soft drink from the makers of Mountain Dew?\n\nLook, I was going over the schematics on my zero-G toilet, and I made a teeny tiny mistake on the specifications for the diverter valve.\n\nHow teeny tiny?\n\nIt's gonna fail after about ten flushes.\n\nBut the mission is for six months.\n\nSee, that's the code red.\n\nIt's kind of like a jack-in-the-box.\n\nNo one knows exactly when, but at some point something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box.\n\nHave you notified NASA?\n\nAre you crazy?\n\nWhat am I gonna say? \"I screwed up your toilet and there's gonna be crap floating \"all over your nice shiny space station\"?\n\nWhat are you gonna do?\n\nI'm gonna figure out how to fix it, then I'll tell them.\n\nSo, what do you need us for?\n\nHe can't figure out how to fix it.\n\nYou said you were gonna be supportive.\n\nI'm trying, but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny.\n\nI agree.\n\nIt's the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here.\n\nCheck your messages.\n\nAll right, this is an exact duplicate of the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity\n\nHuman Waste Disposal System as deployed on the\n\nInternational Space Station.\n\nDon't you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity\n\nHuman Waste Distribution System?\n\nGood one.\n\nIt's hilarious. Now...\n\nHere's an approximation of the spare parts available on the Space Station.\n\nWe gotta find a way, using nothing but this, to reinforce this so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine.\n\nYou mean so it doesn't hit the fan?\n\nI have to say,\n\nI thought the toilet humor would get less funny with repetition.\n\nApparently, there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop.\n\nYou busy?\n\nClassified, Leonard.\n\nYeah, it's a regular\n\nManhattan Project.\n\nWhat's up?\n\nTonight's my date with Penny and since we haven't been able to connect by phone...\n\nI'm sorry, it's been broken.\n\nOr e-mail.\n\nYeah, that too. Everything's broken.\n\nAnyway, I was just wondering if you had any last-minute advice.\n\nAll right, well, off the top of my head,\n\nI think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow.\n\nI mean, glacial.\n\nGuys come onto her all the time, so, you need to set yourself apart.\n\nBe a little shy, don't make too much eye contact.\n\nAnd, you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment and-and, you know, fear.\n\nFear?\n\nYeah, like, you're afraid that if you touch her, she'll break.\n\nWell, that plays right into my wheelhouse.\n\nGood, good.\n\nYou kids have fun tonight.\n\nThanks, Leonard.\n\nWhat is that thing anyway?\n\nYou don't know what this is?\n\nGood. Get out.\n\nBe afraid of Penny.\n\nNice. Very crafty.\n\nIt wasn't bad advice.\n\nIt's just wasn't particularly helpful.\n\nFor what it's worth, my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain, we make Jesus cry.\n\nAll right, what if we use this two-inch PVC to reinforce the center cross-support?\n\nNo good.\n\nIt might work for the Japanese and the Americans, but have you seen the size of the Russians they got up there?\n\nThis thing has to hold up against a hearty potato-based diet.\n\nI feel terrible.\n\nMaybe if you were helping, you'd feel better about yourself.\n\nI deliberately tried to sabotage Stuart's date with Penny.\n\nOf course you feel terrible.\n\nYou completely screwed up your karma.\n\nYou don't really believe in that superstition, do you?\n\nIt's not superstition.\n\nIt's practically Newtonian.\n\nFor every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.\n\nLeonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch.\n\nTherefore, he is reborn as a banana slug.\n\nIt's actually a very elegant system.\n\nYou know, what goes around comes around.\n\nSpeaking of what goes around comes around...\n\nOkay, look.\n\nInstead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely?\n\nIt won't work. The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.\n\nWhat if we reposition the collection tank?\n\nIt won't work. No way to mount it.\n\nOkay, here's an idea.\n\nWhat if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband, Avi, in Israel?\n\nThat could work.\n\nMorning.\n\nMorning. What's up?\n\nNothing. We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity... pasta maker.\n\nI'm gonna make a coffee run.\n\nDo you want any?\n\nNo, thanks. I have coffee.\n\nGreat. So how'd it go with Stuart last night?\n\nI really don't want to talk about it.\n\nYeah. Right. Sure.\n\nThe thing is, before you guys went out,\n\nI spoke to him and...\n\nI said I don't want to talk about it.\n\nI just... I kind of...\n\nWhat goes on between me and Stuart is none of your business.\n\nSo just leave it alone, okay?\n\nIf you want to clean up your karma, go get my freakin' latte.\n\nHang on, I think I've got this.\n\nHelp me see if we can wedge this little piece of PVC behind the support rod.\n\nYou're overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure you're building.\n\nSheldon, I know what I'm doing.\n\nIf you knew what you were doing, there wouldn't be a space toilet where my coffee table should be.\n\nHoward, wait.\n\nWhy don't you use this instead of the PVC to keep the transverse filter assembly in place?\n\nBecause this is not a spare part from the space station.\n\nThis is the thing from the pizza box that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.\n\nThat what that's for?\n\nIn India, the lid touches the cheese.\n\nOf course, we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera, so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie.\n\nWhere are you going?\n\nComic book store.\n\nAn excellent idea!\n\nI could certainly use a break.\n\nMe, too.\n\nYou can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space.\n\nWhy does Leonard get to go? 'Cause he's upset over his situation with Penny and if I have to hear about it again,\n\nI'm going to kick him in his ovaries.\n\nThanks for understanding, Howard.\n\nI got your back, sister.\n\nAll right, I think we've got a prototype ready to test.\n\nHand me that Tupperware.\n\nThat's heavy.\n\nDamn right it's heavy.\n\nIt's my mother's meat loaf.\n\nIt's been testing toilets for generations.\n\nI must say,\n\nI think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your master's degree.\n\nOkay, simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in... three, two, one.\n\nFascinating.\n\nWhat do you think the problem is?\n\nNot enough bread crumbs.\n\nHey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.\n\nSure, what's up?\n\nI gave you bad advice about Penny, and I want to apologize.\n\nNo, your advice was great.\n\nIt was?\n\nYeah, going slow really worked.\n\nYou're kidding.\n\nNever worked for me.\n\nLast night at dinner,\n\nI did what you told me.\n\nI went really slow,\n\nI kept my distance, and two bottles of wine later, we were making out in my car.\n\nWine? I didn't say to give her wine.\n\nIt doesn't matter, that's where it all went to hell.\n\nDuring the kissing?\n\nWhat did you do, sneeze in her mouth?\n\nI did that to a girl once.\n\nNo, everything was good and really hot.\n\nAnd I said, \"Oh, Penny,\" and right where she was supposed to say, \"Oh, Stuart,\" she said... your name.\n\nThat is your name, right?\n\nI'm sorry. That must've been the last thing you wanted to hear.\n\nIt beats, \"You know I'm a dude, right?\"\n\nYeah, it was pretty bad.\n\nNo doubt, no doubt.\n\nI'm sorry it didn't work out.\n\nNot your fault.\n\nYeah, how about that?\n\nSee you soon.\n\nSure.\n\nYes, sir, I understand \"classified.\"\n\nWe'll keep it all classified; no one has to know but you and me.\n\nWhat's classified?\n\nHoward's space toilet.\n\nI'll tell you later.\n\nWell, they've deployed our solution.\n\nLet's just all hope it works.\n\nI don't see why I have to worry.\n\nMy career's not hanging in the balance.\n\nThat was a joke.\n\nIt's funny, because it's true.\n\nLeonard, could you pass the soy sauce, please?\n\nI'm sorry, were you talking to me?\n\nYeah, I said \"Leonard.\"\n\nYes, you did, didn't you?\n\nWhat the hell is that?\n\nMeatloaf.\n\nWhat was it doing on the ceiling?\n\nThat's classified.\n\nInternational Space Station.</i> an unscheduled space walk.</i> involved in this

National Science Foundation to detect slow-moving monopoles at the magnetic North Pole?\n\nHardly a day goes by when I don't think about it.\n\nHow nice.\n\nWell, a space opened up at the last minute on the NSF expedition to the Arctic Circle.\n\nWait a minute.\n\nHe offered to send you to the North Pole?\n\nIn fact, he was quite enthusiastic.\n\nHe said, \"Frankly, if I could send you tonight, I would.\"\n\nOkay, well, do you want to go?\n\nOf course not.\n\nI'm a theoretical physicist.\n\nA career I chose in no small part because it's indoors, but if I'm able to detect slow-moving magnetic

Instead of saying, \"No, we don't want to go on an NSF expedition,\" say, \"No, we don't want to spend \"three months stuck in a cabin in the Arctic Circle with an anal nutbag.\"\n\nBut if we were part of the team that confirmed string theory, we could drink for free in any bar in any college town with a university that has a strong science program.\n\nHoward, this is big science.\n\nYou could be the engineer who builds the equipment that puts us on the cover of magazines.\n\nI could also be the engineer who builds the crossbow that kills Sheldon.\n\nYou still might get on a magazine.\n\nSo you guys are seriously considering this?\n\nYou think you can put up with Sheldon?\n\nWell, I'm a Hindu.\n\nMy religion teaches that if we suffer in this life we are rewarded in the next.\n\nThree months at the North Pole with Sheldon, and I'm reborn as a well-hung billionaire with wings!\n\nWell, gentlemen, have you reached a decision?\n\nI'm in.\n\nMe, too.\n\nDamn it. Peer pressure. Fine.\n\nExcellent.\n\nJust an FYI, as I am the expedition's team leader, protocol dictates that be phrased, \"Fine, sir.\"\n\nBut don't worry, there will be a briefing.\n\nWhat do you want?\n\nI need access to the Cheesecake\n\nFactory's walk-in freezer.\n\nHoney, I already told you, the hamburger meat is fresh and stored at a safe temperature.\n\nThis is to train for a three-month expedition to the magnetic North Pole.\n\nWhat?\n\nI don't know how that sentence could possibly confuse you... but to elaborate,\n\nI'm going to the Arctic Circle with Leonard, Wolowitz and Koothrappali.\n\nYou're all going?\n\nYes.\n\nFor three months?\n\nYes.\n\nExcuse me.\n\nIs that a yes or a no on the freezer?\n\nThat woman has the attention span of a gnat.\n\nSheldon says you're going to the North Pole.\n\nPretty cool, huh?\n\nYeah. I'm just a little surprised you didn't tell me.\n\nIt all happened kind of fast.\n\nAnd we had to get physicals and buy thermal underwear and study up on, you know, snow and stuff.\n\nSorry, I was gonna tell you.\n\nYou don't have to apologize.\n\nThere's no reason you have to tell me.\n\nI was just... you know, surprised.\n\nYou were busy, you were surprised, all very fascinating.\n\nNow where do we stand on the freezer?\n\nIs he serious?\n\nActually, it would help.\n\nAll right, I'll see what I can do.\n\nSo, three months at the North Pole.\n\nThat is... awesome.\n\nI'm sorry, but at what point do you put this \"see what you can do\" plan into action?\n\nJust a warning, Sheldon...\n\nThe freezer locks from the outside.\n\nDid she seem upset to you?\n\nDid she seem upset to you?\n\nGood, I got it right.\n\nAre you upset?\n\nA little bit.\n\nTwo for two. I'm on fire.\n\nI know she's not my girlfriend or anything, but wouldn't you think she'd feel a little bad that I'm going to be gone for the whole summer?\n\nThat feels like a bonus question.\n\nI'm going to stop here while I'm ahead, but I've had a great time.\n\nAll right, the purpose of this drill is to acclimate us to the use of tools in extreme temperatures such as we will face in the Arctic Circle.\n\nWhere are your tools?\n\nRight here.\n\nAll right, team, open up your practice kits.\n\nAs the university did not permit me to bring the actual equipment we'll be using to the Cheesecake Factory, because apparently,\n\nI'm \"ridiculous,\"\n\nI've provided substitutes which will exercise your fine motor skills.\n\nLeonard, you will be doing a series of complex mathematical problems on a vintage Casio model when I won the Earth Science medal in 3rd grade.\n\nTreat it with respect.\n\nRaj, you will be painting sideburns and a Van Dyke on a six-inch figurine of Legolas the elf.\n\nNow, remember, a Van Dyke is a goatee without a mustache.\n\nWolowitz, you will be completing a series of delicate surgical procedures on the classic children's game \"Operation.\"\n\nTo begin with, you will \"remove funny bone for two hundred dollars.\"\n\nFor this I went to MIT.\n\nAnd begin.\n\nI think I swallowed some paint!\n\nI can't press any of the buttons with my gloves.\n\nSon of a bitch!\n\nAdversity is to be expected.\n\nContinue.\n\nOh, boy, am I gonna get sued.\n\nOkay, I can't do this.\n\nMe either.\n\nGentlemen, use your imagination.\n\nInnovate.\n\nDid Han Solo let Luke Skywalker freeze to death on the ice planet of Hoth?\n\nHe cut open a tauntaun and used its internal body heat to warm him up.\n\nYou heard the man.\n\nHold him down and I'll cut him open.\n\nHang on, I know I don't possess the tools of leadership, but why can't we assemble the equipment inside the hut and then take it outside?\n\nI hadn't thought of that.\n\nI guess we're done here.\n\nHere, drink slash eat this.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nHot chocolate with a stick of butter.\n\nOkay, why?\n\nIn the frigid temperatures in the Arctic, we need to consume at least just to maintain our body weight.\n\nYou know I can't eat butter.\n\nI'm lactose intolerant.\n\nWay ahead of you, that's an \"I Can't Believe It's Not Butter\" stick.\n\nBut Mummy, all the other guys are going to the North Pole. what the other guys are doing.</i> in the Bay of Bengal</i> would you follow them?</i>\n\nIf you were standing behind me nagging, I might.\n\nThis trip is much too dangerous.</i>\n\nNo, it's not. Howard, tell them.\n\nDoctor and Mrs. Koothrappali,\n\nI understand your concern, but if it'll make you feel any better, my mother is fine with me going, and it's a woman who kept a safety rail on my bed until I was 17. with her son being eaten by a walrus?</i>\n\nThat's very unlikely,\n\nMrs. Koothrappali.\n\nIf Raj dies, it'll be from frostbite, gangrene, acute sunburn or being ripped to shreds by a 1,500 pound polar bear.\n\nMa, I'm putting you on speakerphone with Raj's parents.\n\nCan you tell them that you're okay with me going to the Arctic?\n\nI thought you said Arkansas!</i>\n\nI didn't say that.\n\nYou never listen to me! because he's ashamed!</i>\n\nCan I talk to you for a sec?\n\nSure, but let's go out here where there's a little less yelling and guilt.\n\nWhat's up?\n\nWell, I got you a little going away present.\n\nA blanket.\n\nNo, not just a blanket.\n\nSee, it has sleeves.\n\nSo, you can be all snoodled up while you do your science stuff.\n\nCool.\n\nI'm gonna miss you.\n\nSee you later.\n\nBye.\n\nWhy don't you believe me?</i> that in the entire country of India,</i>\n\nI want a cookie, Meemaw.\n\nIt's me.\n\nBut Meemaw just made cookies.\n\nI don't know if I can go on the expedition.\n\nWhat?\n\nI don't think I can go to the North Pole.\n\nI know you're concerned about disappointing me but I want you to take comfort from the knowledge that my expectations of you are very low.\n\nYeah, that's very comforting.\n\nComforting is a part of leadership.\n\nIt's not a part I care for, but such is my burden.\n\nTerrific, it's just that...\n\nI don't think Penny wants me to go.\n\nAssuming that's a valid reason not to go, which it isn't...\n\nHow do you know this?\n\nDid she say it?\n\nNot exactly.\n\nBut she said she was gonna miss me and she gave me this.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nIt's a blanket with sleeves.\n\nThat's clever.\n\nLet me see if I understand correctly.\n\nHer missing you is an emotional state you find desirable?\n\nYes, obviously.\n\nWell, given that missing you is predicated on you leaving, logic dictates you must leave.\n\nYes, okay, but I'm gonna be gone for three months.\n\nWhat if she doesn't miss me that long and she meets someone else?\n\nShe does have a short attention span.\n\nSo, I can't go.\n\nLeonard, you may be right.\n\nIt appears that Penny secretly wants you in her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion.\n\nYou really think so?\n\nOf course not.\n\nEven in my sleep-deprived state,\n\nI've managed to pull off another one of my classic pranks.\n\nBazinga!\n\nWhat time is it?\n\nIt's 7:00 a.m. I'm sorry it's early, but we're leaving soon, and I needed to talk to you.\n\nWhat did you mean when you said you were going to miss me?\n\nI don't know.\n\nYou'll be gone and I'll notice.\n\nWhat about this?\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nWine, credit card and late night television are a bad combination.\n\nAll right, fine.\n\nWhat about that really long hug?\n\nWhat did that mean?\n\nThat wasn't a long hug.\n\nIt was at least five Mississippis.\n\nA standard hug is two Mississippis tops.\n\nLeonard, I don't know what to tell you.\n\nIt was just a hug.\n\nGlad we cleared that up.\n\nYeah.\n\nI guess I'll see you.\n\nOkay, have a safe trip.\n\nThank you.\n\nBye.\n\nOkay, bye.\n\nIt means I wish you weren't going.\n\nDamn it.\n\nWhat?\n\nWe're out of ice.\n\nAll right, we begin initial assembly and deployment of the testing equipment starting tomorrow at 0700 hours, but until then, you are all off duty.\n\nI suggest you keep the shenanigans to a minimum as medical help is\n\nWhat are you working on?\n\nCrossbow.\n\nHey, guys, can I just say something?\n\nHow about we take a moment to think about where we are right now?\n\nThis is literally the top of the world.\n\nOnly a handful of people in all of human history will ever see what we are going to see.\n\nHe's right.\n\nIt is remarkable.\n\nSo, who's up for a movie?\n\nGood idea, what do you think? or John Carpenter's <i>The Thing</i>?\n\nI say double feature.\n\nDinner's ready!\n\nWhat are we having?\n\nReconstituted Thai food.\n\nDid you bring the dehydrated low-sodium soy sauce?\n\nFreeze-dried spicy mustard?\n\nCheck.\n\nFlash-frozen brown rice, not white?\n\nSorry.\n\nNot to worry.\n\nI hid it.\n\nBazinga!\n\nYou're in my spot.\n\nThere's no time for a crossbow.\n\nFind me an icicle.\n\nThree months.\n\nThis is gonna be great.\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "c543683e-7d50-4448-bb3c-2d086aa01222": {"__data__": {"id_": "c543683e-7d50-4448-bb3c-2d086aa01222", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "baee1639b1617eb7a5868423e3f5ba05cdd03adde44fbd44c58fe0d1901dd05b", "text": "\n\nI just want you both to know, when I publish my findings,\n\nI won't forget your contributions.\n\nGreat.\n\nThanks.\n\nOf course, I can't mention you in my Nobel acceptance speech, but when I get around to writing my memoirs, you can expect a very effusive footnote and perhaps a signed copy.\n\nWe have to tell him.\n\nTell me what?\n\nDamn his Vulcan hearing.\n\nYou fellows are planning a party for me, aren't you?\n\nOkay, Sheldon, sit down.\n\nIf there's going to be a theme,\n\nI should let you know that I don't care for luau, toga or \"under the sea.\"\n\nYeah, we'll keep that in mind.\n\nLook...\n\nWe need to talk to you about something that happened at the North Pole.\n\nIf this is about the night the heat went out, there's nothing to be embarrassed about.\n\nIt's not about that.\n\nWe agreed to never speak of it again.\n\nSo we slept together naked.\n\nIt was only to keep our core body temperatures from plummeting.\n\nHe's speaking about it.\n\nFor me, it was a bonding moment.\n\nSheldon, you remember the first few weeks we were looking for magnetic monopoles and not finding anything and you were acting like an obnoxious, giant dictator?\n\nWe were gonna be gentle with him.\n\nThat's why I added the \"tator.\"\n\nAnd when we finally got our first positive data, you were so happy.\n\nIn the world of emoticons,\n\nI was colon, capital \"D.\"\n\nWell, in actuality, what your equipment detected wasn't so much evidence of paradigm-shifting monopoles as it was... static from the electric can opener we were turning on and off.\n\nHe just went colon, capital \"O.\"\n\nYou tampered with my experiment?\n\nWe had to.\n\nIt was the only way to keep you from being such a huge Dickensian.\n\nYou see that?

I've been to The Gap.\n\nI've been there, as well.\n\nI like your t-shirts with the little pocket.\n\nI work there, too. Not that anyone cares.\n\nYou know, this place is boring.\n\nYeah, why don't we go somewhere else and have some fun?\n\nOkay.\n\nSure, we like fun.\n\nWe are fun people.\n\nDark and fun.\n\nCome on.  I know a place you'll really dig.\n\nDid you bring the black condoms?\n\nIn my fanny pack.\n\nLet's go.\n\nAre you happy now?\n\nNot particularly.\n\nMy God, she didn't!\n\nWhat could she possibly be talking about for so long?\n\nObviously, waitressing at The Cheese Cake Factory is a complex socio-economic activity that requires a great deal of analysis and planning. \"Bazinga. \"\n\nYou know, using positive reinforcement techniques,\n\nI could train that behaviour out of her in a week.\n\nNo.\n\nIf you let me use negative reinforcement, I can get it done before we go to bed.\n\nYou're not squirting her in the face with water.\n\nNo, of course not.\n\nWe're talking very mild electric shocks.\n\nNo tissue damage whatsoever.\n\nForget it.\n\nOh, come on. You can't tell me that you're not intrigued about the possibility of building a better girlfriend.\n\nI'm not.\n\nWell, and Penny's qualities, both good and bad, are what make her what she is.\n\nYou mean, like that high-pitched, irritating laugh?\n\nYes.\n\nYou wouldn't prefer a throaty chuckle?\n\nYou're not changing how Penny laughs.\n\nNo, that would be incongruous.\n\nI was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing register.\n\nSorry, guys. That girl is freaky.\n\nCome again?\n\nFreaky.\n\nFreaky?\n\nYeah, freaky.\n\nHave a chocolate.\n\nThank you.\n\nAre you seriously going to deface your body just for the possibility you could have cheap sex\n\nWith a strange girl you met in a bar?\n\nYeah!\n\nWhat is your mother going to say?\n\nShe's not going to see it.\n\nShe takes my temperature orally now.\n\nWhat are you going to get, Howard?\n\nWell, I can't really decide between a screaming devil, this mean little skull, or Kermit the frog.\n\nKermit the frog?\n\nYou know. Im on Howards butt.\n\nGet the mean little skull, and I'll see if I can make him smile.\n\nYeah, I'd like the mean little skull, please.\n\nWhat are you going to get, Raj?\n\nWith my luck, hepatitis.\n\nOkay, here we go.\n\nThat's just rubbing alcohol.\n\nI know, but it was cold.\n\nI'm putting on the stencil.\n\nWhat comes after the stencil?\n\nThis.\n\nOkay, that's it. No needle. No pain. No tattoo.\n\nWhat's the big deal? Youve done this before.\n\nNo, I haven't. Look.\n\nI'm sorry. Im a fraud. Hes a fraud.\n\nWe're both frauds.\n\nYeah, I think I covered that.\n\nBut I was summing up.\n\nWe're not Goth.\n\nWe're just... guys.\n\nVery, very smart guys.\n\nSo you were totally scamming us?\n\nYes.\n\nAnd I wouldn't blame you if you walked out of here and never wanted to see us again.\n\nUnless, of course, our bold honesty has suddenly made us attractive, huh? Anything?\n\nI'm leaving.\n\nI'm leaving, too. Not that anyone cares.\n\nWhen we tell this story, let's end it differently.\n\nWhat are you thinking? Maybe a big musical number?\n\nWell, Im going to make some warm milk and then turn in.\n\nI trust if you two are planning on engaging in amorous activities, you'll keep the decibel level to a minimum.\n\nOf course.\n\nThank you.\n\nThese are so good.\n\nUnbelievable.\n\nWhat?\n\nI-I was just thinking we should probably turn in, too.\n\nWell, you know, my new bed got delivered.\n\nIf you come over and put it together, you can stay at my place.\n\nReally? Thats a lot of work, and it's kind of late.\n\nYeah, but if we stay there, we won't have to be quiet.\n\nLets go.\n\nInteresting.\n\nSex works even better than chocolate to modify behaviour.\n\nI wonder if anyone else has stumbled onto that.\n\nOkay, wait.  How about this?\n\nWe say there were four Goth girls.\n\nThe two girls in the club had two friends.\n\nI like it, I like it.\n\nDid they smell good despite their Goth-like nature?\n\nWhat's that got to do with the story?\n\nEngaging my olfactory sense helps make it real for me.\n\nFine, they smelled good.\n\nOh, they did. Like jasmine and honeysuckle\n\nWhatever.\n\nAnd then they held hands and did a sexy, demonic, hokey pokey for us.\n\nNo, no. Look, let me just say my story all the way through\n\nAnd then you can say yours, and then we'll pick.\n\nIm sorry. Go on.\n\nOkay.\n\nWe got tattoos, and then the four girls took us to their place.\n\nBut we don't have tattoos. What if someone asks to see our tattoos?\n\nWe say they're in a very intimate area.\n\nOh, we are bad boys, aren't we?\n\nRight, right.\n\nSo, we go back to their place and then the six of us end up in a hot tub.\n\nBut we just got tattoos. Wouldnt we be concerned about bacterial infection?\n\nTrue. Okay. Forget the hot tub.\n\nThe point is, we each had a menage with sexy Goth girls.\n\nWhat a great night.\n\nYeah.\n\nHey, want to try a country bar tomorrow night?\n\nMaybe we'll get lucky with some sexy cowgirls.\n\nCould happen.\n\nI wonder how they smell. proudly presents</font> www.addic7ed.com\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "0c6e3547-597f-4f55-a26b-4d00167d691d": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c6e3547-597f-4f55-a26b-4d00167d691d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "82a7938269bcc939e97c224d7bb2694e346a0daf861b7fae736d456c39fed59e", "text": "  \ufeff1\n\nThis movie baffles me every time we watch it.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nThe instructions are very clear: \"Don't feed the Gremlins after midnight.\" \"Don't get the Gremlins wet.\"\n\nHow hard is that?\n\nHi, guys.\n\nHi, honey.\n\nHey.\n\nOoh, we're \"honey\" now, are we?\n\nYes. Since their relationship became carnal,\n\nPenny has upgraded his designated term of endearment, thus distinguishing him from those she calls \"sweetie,\" usually in an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult.\n\nYou're boring people, sweetie.\n\nAlthough, sometimes, she omits the veil entirely.\n\nSo, what are you guys doing?\n\nCelebrating Columbus day.\n\nThey're all written by Chris Columbus.\n\nOkay.\n\nWhat do you watch on Thanksgiving?\n\nThe parade.\n\nOh, you know, that reminds me--\n\nI usually go back to Nebraska for Thanksgiving, but this year they're calling it off on account of my brother's trial.\n\nWhat's he on trial for?\n\nOh, just a big misunderstanding.\n\nYou know, you'd actually li my brother.\n\nHe's kind of a chemist.\n\nAnyway, I was thinking I'd have Thanksgiving here, and you are all invited.\n\nOh. I'll be there.\n\nWill you be serving cranberry jelly or cranberry sauce?\n\nI guess I could serve both.\n\nYou guess? You don't seem to have much of a handle on this.\n\nYeah, I really wish I could, Penny, but every year, mother has all the relatives over and cooks up her famous tur-briska-fil.\n\nTur-briska-fil?\n\nTurkey stuffed with a brisket stuffed with gefilte fish.\n\nIt's not as good as it sounds.\n\nRaj, what about you?\n\nOh, he usually comes to my house. Right, pal?\n\nAll right, this year, you don't have to eat the tur-briska-fil.\n\nI don't even chew it.\n\nI swallow it like pills.\n\nSo, what's going on with Raj?\n\nWell, the good news is, he has no problem with my mother's tur-briska-fil.\n\nHard to believe, but go on.\n\nThe bad news is, he says he'getting deported.\n\nLeonard: What do you mean, he's getting deported?\n\nI believe it means that the US Government is going to expel him from the country.\n\nHe could then either return to his native India, emigrate to another country that's willing to accept him or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate.\n\nPersonally, I'd choose pirate.\n\nPenny, would you mind stepping outside so we can speak to him?\n\nBut the man really needs to work on his girl issues.\n\nAnother reason to consider life of piracy.\n\nEven today, I understand that's an all-male profession.\n\nOkay, she's gone.\n\nSorry. I lost my cool.\n\nSo, what's going on?\n\nOkay, here's the deal:\n\nSix months ago, my research testing the predicted composition of trans-Neptunian objects ran into a dead end.\n\nSo?\n\nSo, my visa's only good\n\nAs long as I'm employed at the university and when they find out I've got squat, they're going to cut me off.\n\nBy the way, when I say squat, I mean diddly-squat.\n\nI wish I had squat.\n\nSo, wait, what have you been doing for the past six months?\n\nYou know, checking e-mail, updating my Facebook status, messing up Wikipedia entries.\n\nHey, did you know Netflix lets you stream movies on your computer now?\n\nAnd you've continued to take the universit's money under false pretenses?\n\nHighly unethical for an astrophysicist.\n\nAlthough pctically mandatory for a pirate.\n\nI don't want to go back to India.\n\nIt's hot and loud, and there's so many people.\n\nYou have no idea--they're everywhere.\n\nOkay, guys, think.\n\nHow do we keep Raj in the country?\n\nPenny: Why doesn't he just get another job?\n\nWhat are you asking me for?\n\nI don't know if you can talk now or not.\n\nOh, beef...\n\nI'm going to miss you so much.\n\nDo you know, at the Mumbai McDonald's,\n\nYou can't get a Big Mac?\n\nAll you can get is a Chicken Maharaja Mac.\n\nAnd the special sauce-- curry-- which, in India, believe you me, iIs really not that special.\n\nDon't worry, you'll find another job.\n\nYeah, let me start practicing for it. \"Do you want fries with that Maharaja Mac?\"\n\nSheldon: Hi, Leonard.\n\nHello, Raj.\n\nHello sheldon.\n\nForgive me, as you know, I'm not adept at reading facial cues, but I'm going to take a stab here:\n\nYou're either sad or nauseated.\n\nI'm sad.\n\nI was going to say sad.\n\nI don't know why I hedged.\n\nWhat are you eating?\n\nElbow macaroni with ground hamburger and tomato sauce.\n\nOh, beefaroni.\n\nI think I'll miss you most of all.\n\nI've always been a little confused about this.\n\nWhy don't hindus eat beef?\n\nWe believe cows are gods.\n\nNot technically.\n\nDo not tell me about my own culture, Sheldon!\n\nIn the mood I'm in, I'll take you out-- I swear to cow!\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nMe, too.\n\nI'm st...I'm a little on edge.\n\nUnderstandable.\n\nYour entire life seems to be crumbling around you, and your future appears bleak at best.\n\nThank you.\n\nAnd you're wrong about Hinduism and cows.\n\nHey, Raj, guess what.\n\nProfessor Laughlin is looking for someone to join the stellar evolution research team.\n\nYou-you're kidding! That's fantastic! What are you waiting for? Call him and set up an interview.\n\nI'm on it.\n\nThat's happy, right?\n\nYeah.\n\nNailed it.\n\nDr Koothrappali, come on in.\n\nI was surprised to here you were interested in joining our little team.\n\nGiving up on those trans-Neptunian objects, are we?\n\nNo, no; it's a very promising area.\n\nIn a perfect world I'd spend several more years on it.\n\nBut I just couldn'pass up the opportunity to work with you on your tremendously exciting, and not yet conclusively disproved, hypothesis.\n\nSplendid.\n\nUh, please sit down.\n\nCan I offer you a sherry?\n\nIt's a little early, isn't it?\n\nNot on Proxima Centauri.\n\nJolly amusing, but if you don't mind,\n\nI'll hold off until sunset on Titan.\n\nI have a feeling you're going to fit in just fine, Dr Koothrappali.\n\nThank you, sir.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nAm I late?\n\nNo, no, no. Right on time.\n\nDr Koothrappali, may I present\n\nDr Millstone from MIT.\n\nShe'll be heading up our data analysis team.\n\nIt's nice to meet you, Dr Koothrappali.\n\nI read your paper on Kuiper Belt object size distribution.\n\nI really enjoyed it.\n\nHow did you correct for the selection bias?\n\nWell, I ran a simulation that allowed me to correct for the observational efficiency.\n\nThat's just fascinating.\n\nThank you.\n\nWould you like to hear more about it in my hot tub?\n\nSo, when do I start?\n\nWhat do you mean you didn't get the job?\n\nHow could you not get it?\n\nYou know... he's British; I'm Indian.\n\nEver since Gandhi, they haven't liked us very much.\n\nWait, are you saying that he discriminated against you?\n\nBecause we should file a complaint.\n\nThat's okay.\n\nA complaint has been filed.\n\nSo, that's it.\n\nThat was my last hope.\n\nI'm going to be deported, sent home in disgrace, exposed to the sardonic barb of my cousin Sanjay.\n\nOr, as you may know him, Dave from AT & T Customer Service.\n\nI'm really going to miss you.\n\nWill you come visit me in India?\n\nGee, that's, like, a 17-hour flight.\n\nHow about I meet you halfway?\n\nHalfway is 600 miles off the coast of Japan.\n\nTell you what, we'll Skype.\n\nGentlemen.\n\nLeonard: Hey. Raj, did you get the job with professor Laughlin?\n\nNo.\n\nI assumed as much.\n\nBut never fear.\n\nLike the subordinate male protagonist in countless action movies who disappears half way through the second reel,\n\nI have returned to save the day.\n\nOdd.\n\nUsually, he's met by cheers.\n\nAnyway,\n\nI was thinking about exploring the string theory implications of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations, and it occurred to me that I could benefit--\n\nExcuse me, Sheldon.\n\nHow many reels before the subordinate male protagonist gets to his point?\n\nI'm sorry-- if you didn't cheer at my entrance, it's too late to buy into the premise.\n\nAnyway, I got some extra money from the head of the department, and Raj can come work for me.\n\nYou're going to have to listen more carefully when you're on the job.\n\nAy, uh, please don't take this the wrong way, but I'd rather swim buck-naked across the Ganges with a paper cut on my nipple and die a slow, agonizing death from a viral infection, than work with you.\n\nSheldon, are you busy?\n\nOf course I'm busy.\n\nShall I wait?\n\nHow may I help you?\n\nI've reconsidered your offer to let me work with you.\n\nI do, however, have a few conditions.\n\nFirst, at all times,\n\nI am to be treated as a colleague and an equal.\n\nSecond, my contributions shall be noted in all published material.\n\nAnd third, you are never allowed to lecture me on Hinduism or my Indian culture.\n\nI'm impressed, Raj.\n\nThose are very cogent and reasonable conditions.\n\nThank you.\n\nThen you leave me no choice.\n\nI accept the job.\n\nI'm sorry, I believe you've misunderstood.\n\nI'm not giving you the job.\n\nI'm simply affording you the opportunity to apply for it.\n\nHave a seat; we'll get started with the interview.\n\nWha... you're kidding!\n\nPlease.\n\nSo... (Sighs) that's what you wear to an interview?\n\nCome on, dude, we've been friends for years.\n\nOh, pulling strings, are we?\n\nSheldon, for God's sakes, don't make me beg.\n\nBazinga!\n\nYou've fallen victim to another one of my classic practical jokes.\n\nI'm your boss now. You may want to laugh at that.\n\nAh, nice having the place to ourselves, isn't it?\n\nUh-huh.\n\nNow that Raj is working for Sheldon,\n\nI don't have to chauffeur him around anymore.\n\nPlus, yeah, with them working late so much, we get some privacy.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nHey, want to get a little crazy?\n\nWhat are you thinking?\n\nLet's slide over to Sheldon's spot a make out.\n\nYou are a dirty girl.\n\nOh, God, how did he know?\n\nHello.\n\nHi, Howard. (Wry laugh)\n\nAm I interrupting?\n\nLittle bit, yeah.\n\nGuess I should have called.\n\nYeah, maybe.\n\nTonight's the night I usually go line dancing with Raj at the Palomino.\n\nUh-huh.\n\nBut he's working with Sheldon.\n\nYes, we know.\n\nWant me to leave?\n\nYou know, whatever.\n\nOkay, I guess I can hang for a little while.\n\nSo what are we watching?\n\nHey, I happen to love this movie.\n\nFine, let's watch it.\n\nMaybe all our periods will synchronize.\n\nAll right, we're going to be designing an experiment to look for the nihilation spectrum resulting from dark matter collisions in space.\n\nOoh, dark matter.\n\nWe better bring a flashlight.\n\nI was making a joke.\n\nI'm the boss.\n\nI make the jokes.\n\nSorry go ahead and make your joke.\n\nThis is not the time for joking.\n\nWe're doing serious research,\n\nWhich requires complete and utter focus.\n\nAll right, let's buckle down and work. by Survivor playing)\n\nSheldon.\n\nWhat?\n\nI need an aspirin.\n\nTop desk drawer.\n\nThank you.\n\nAlright?\n\nYes.\n\nGood.\n\nThat was fun.\n\nThank you.\n\nLeonard, honey, you don't have to say thank you every time we have sex.\n\nOh. Okay.\n\nTomorrow you're going to get a card in the mail.\n\nJust throw it away.\n\nWhat are you doing here?\n\nWell, usually, on Sundays, I go with Raj to scam on hippie chicks at the farmer's market, but he's still working with Sheldon, so I thought I'd come over here and make you guys scrambled eggs and salami.\n\nOh, kill me.\n\nBy the way, I couldn't help overhearing your big finish.\n\nBravo, Leonard.\n\nSee, if you had killed me when I said \"kill me,\"\n\nI wouldn't have had to hear that. (Stammers)\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nWant to take in a matinee, maybe go rollerblading, catch a step class?\n\nDo something.\n\nOkay.\n\nUm, Howard, we need to talk.\n\nSure. 'sup, homes?\n\nUh... please understand that it's not that we don't want you around, but Penny and I occasionally need some... alone time.\n\nOh.\n\nI-I get it, I'm the third wheel.\n\nSorry, I should have seen that.\n\nI'll get out of your way.\n\nUh, you're gonna want to eat those eggs while they're still hot.\n\nThank you.\n\nThere's lochs and cream cheese in the fridge.\n\nThe bagels are in the oven.\n\nThat's great.\n\nI'm just going to hang out with my mom that's always fun\n\nGood.\n\nAre we terrible people?\n\nI don't know.\n\nWhat do you want me to do?\n\nG-get him; bring him back.\n\nAre you sure?\n\nYeah.     Okay.\n\nHoward come back.\n\nOh, you guys had me scared for a minute.\n\nNo, no, no, no!\n\nThat rate is much too low from what we'd expect from this collision.\n\nDo you understand we're talking about dark matter colliding in outer space?\n\nOf course I understand.\n\nI'm the astrophysicist. \"Astro\" means \"Ppace.\" \"Astor\" means \"Star.\"\n\nOkay, well, let me just tell you, if we we having this argument in my native language, I'd be kicking your butt.\n\nOkay, you got me there, but you're wrong about this!\n\nThere is a fine line between wrong and visionary.\n\nUnfortunately you have to be a visionary to see it.\n\nMy God, you think that every thought that comes out of your head is pure gold.\n\nWell, let me tell you something.\n\nSome of those thoughts are pure caca. \n\nCaca\n\nIt means \"doo-doo.\"\n\nAll right!\n\nFirst of all, Dr Koothrappali, when I first proposed that you work with me..\n\nAha! So I am working with you.\n\nIn this context, \"with me\" means \"for me.\"\n\nAh, well, in this context...\n\nOh!\n\nIf I'm wrong, prove it.\n\nOkay.\n\nHere's where we derive the mass of the dark matter particle.\n\nYou've mis-stated the atomic weight of the target.\n\nLet me finish.\n\nYou're defacing my work.\n\nI'm not defacing it, I'm fixing it.\n\nGive me the eraser.\n\nNo.\n\nI said give it to me.\n\nCome and get it.\n\nFine.\n\nOh, Lord.\n\nDr Koothrappali, as your superior, I forbid you from writing on my board!\n\nYou are not my superior.\n\nI am in every way.\n\nOh, yeah?\n\nCan you do this?\n\nNice working with you.\n\nRaj...\n\nRaj... Raj...\n\nI'm busy.\n\nDoing what?\n\nAll right, you've made your point.\n\nWhat do you want, Sheldon?\n\nI looked overr the board and it turns out you were right.\n\nSo you were wrong.\n\nI didn't say that.\n\nThat's the only logical inference.\n\nNevertheless, I didn't say it.\n\nAnyway, I would like you to come back and work for me.\n\nIn this context \"for me\" could mean \"with me.\"\n\nAll right, but I have some conditions.\n\nI reject them all.\n\nI'll take the job.\n\nSee you Monday.\n\nWait, you have to drive me home.\n\nHow did you get here?\n\nI walked.\n\nSo walk home.\n\nI can't.\n\nThere's a big dog outside.\n\nOn the way home, we can start thinking about methods of optimizing the detector for 500 gev particles.\n\nAll right.\n\nDone by: mosito1001 www.addic7ed.com\n\nWarnerros.

I'll ask if she has a friend for you.\n\nA hot friend.\n\nRight.\n\nAnd tall.\n\nI want our kids to be able to ride space mountain before they're 20.\n\nI'll see what I can do.\n\nHey, Sheldon, guess what I heard today?\n\nI'd imagine you heard any number of things today.\n\nWhen you arrived at work you undoubtedly heard, \"Hello, Raj\". \"How are you, Raj?\"\n\nGiven that you're wearing a new sweater-vest, you may have heard \"new sweater vest?\".\n\nAnd possibly, though far less likely, \"nice sweater-vest\".\n\nWhy don't I just tell you what I heard today.\n\nThat would probably save us some time.\n\nSaturday night at the comic book store, they're having a \"Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah\" tournament.\n\nFirst prize is $500 dollars.\n\nIf we team up, we'd be unstoppable.\n\nI'm sorry, Raj, but I have no interest in playing a game in which I find no challenge.\n\nWhat about the money?\n\nI have money.\n\nThis is other money.\n\nHow does it different from the money I have?\n\nHalf of it will be mine.\n\nDo you need it to buy a less disturbing sweater-vest?\n\nLeonard, help.\n\nAre you kidding?\n\nI couldn't even talk him into giving me one of his freakin' napkins.\n\nWow, you really are a genius.\n\nNot really.\n\nI googled how to do that.\n\nSo, listen...\n\nHave you ever made a pact with someone?\n\nYou mean like a pinky swear?\n\nOkay, fine, like a pinky swear.\n\nWell, in the first grade, my friend Rosie and I made a pact to marry Bert and Ernie.\n\nYou know, from Sesame Street?\n\nI-I'm familiar with Bert and Ernie.\n\nKnowing fact, we both wanted Ernie.\n\nWe didn't speak again until middle school.\n\nOver puppets?\n\nThe heart wants what the heart wants, Leonard.\n\nOkay.\n\nSpeaking of what the heart wants... \n\nUm... a long time ago,\n\nI made a pact with Wolowitz that kind of involves you.\n\nOkay, I don't know where you're going with this, but tread carefully because it may be the last conversation we ever have.\n\nNo, no, nothing like that.\n\nThe deal was that if either of us ever got a girlfriend, we'd have her fix the other one up with one of her friends.\n\nAnd you thought a good time to bring this up be right after sex.\n\nWell, I sure as hell wasn't gonna bring it up before sex.\n\nAnd during, I was trying to remember what I read on google, so...\n\nI'm not hooking Wolowitz up with one of my friends.\n\nC'mon-- it doesn't have to be a good friend.\n\nAnd you know that deep down inside, Howard's a really nice guy.\n\nThe problem isn't what's on the inside.\n\nIt's the creepy candy coating.\n\nWill you at least think about it?\n\nJust as a favor to me?\n\nOh, great thing about Ernie, was he never asked me for anything.\n\nHe just gave.\n\nGot it. Got it. Got it.\n\nGot it. Got it. Got it.\n\nBetty and Veronica?\n\nOff.\n\nHey, Sheldon, the new Green Lantern figurine's coming in tomorrow.\n\nWant me to set one aside for you?\n\nThank you.\n\nYou just robbed me of the opportunity to stumble upon the figurine and make the oh-so-satisfying journey from discovery to desire to possession.\n\nAll right, I won't set one aside for you.\n\nBut I must have it.\n\nOkay, I'll set one aside for you.\n\nThank you.\n\nYou know, I can buy all these things online.\n\nI come here for the personal service.\n\nHey, Stuart, is the Wil Wheaton signed up for the mystic warlords tournament.\n\nThe Wil Wheaton from Star Trek?\n\nYeah, he lives around here. Big gamer.\n\nExcuse me.\n\nAre you saying that Wil Wheaton aka Ensign Wesley Crusher on Star Trek: The next generation is going to be participating in your tournament?\n\nOh, I'm sorry, did I rob you of the opportunity to stumble onto that for yourself?\n\nNo wait-- you don't understand.\n\nGrowing up, I idolized Wil Wheaton\n\nWesley Crusher had an eidetic memory just like me.\n\nOoh, what a coincidence.\n\nMay be you can discuss that with him while you're playing in the tournament.\n\nSign here.\n\nYeah-- I was such a fan that in 1995, I traveled ten hours by bus to a sci-fi convention in Jackson, Mississippi, wearing my star flee academy cadet uniform in order to meet Wil Wheaton and get him to autograph my mint in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.\n\nOoh, it'll be like a reunion then.\n\nSign here.\n\nMy arduous journey, however, was for naught.\n\nAlthough advertised to appear, he did not show up.\n\nIt was at that moment, I vowed eternal hatred for Wil Wheaton.\n\nOkay, great, you can tell him you hate him.\n\nSign here.\n\nIt might also interest you to know that Wil Wheaton currently ranks sixth on my all-time enemies list...  right between director Joel Schumacher, who nearly destroyed the Batman movie franchise, and Billy Sparks, who lived down the street from me and put dog poop on the handles of my bicycle.\n\nOkay, I get it. He's a bad guy.\n\nSign here.\n\nIn the wooords of Khan Noonien Singh in the immortal wrath of Khan, \"he tasks me...\". \"He tasks me and I shall have him\".\n\nNo doubt, sign here. \"From hell's heart, I stab at thee\".\n\nAll right, Raj, looks like you're teamed up with \"die, Wil Wheaton, die\".\n\nSo, tell me more about the future mother of my children.\n\nShe's adorable, Howard.\n\nI think you'll like her.\n\nGreat.\n\nSo what did you tell her about me?\n\nDid you mention the body fat?\n\nNo, I thought that would be a nice surprise for her.\n\nGood, good.\n\nI just told her you're an aerospace engineer, you speak five languages...  six if you count Klingon.\n\nGirls don't count Klingon, Howard.\n\nRight?\n\nRight.\n\nOh. And I told her you have an unhealthy attachment to your mother.\n\nWhat?\n\nI'm kidding.\n\nAnother delightful surprise for her.\n\nSheldon, it's your play.\n\nSheldon.\n\nMy enchanted troll bludgeons your screaming harpy with a cursed mace. Game.\n\nSorry, boys.\n\nSay hi to your mother when she picks you up.\n\nOr I could just tell her later tonight!\n\nWe pawned them, dude! Up top!\n\nLook at him.\n\nWil Wheaton, my old friend.\n\nI have chased you 'round the moons of Nibia and 'round the Antares maelstrom and 'round perdition's flames!\n\nYou know, you keep quoting Wrath of Khan, but he was in next generation.\n\nIt's a totally different set of characters.\n\nSilence!\n\nHow much longer must I wait for my revenge?\n\nWell, if Wil Wheaton and Stuart win their match and we beat lonely Larry and captain sweatpants in the next round, we'll face off for the championship.\n\nSo, my path to satisfaction is blocked by lonely Larry and captain sweatpants.\n\nVery well.\n\nThey must be destroyed.\n\nDude, you have to stop talking like that.\n\nIt's really lame.\n\nSilence!\n\nSo, Penny tells me you're working as a waitress to put yourself through grad school.\n\nThat's pretty great. What are you studying?\n\nMicrobiology.\n\nOh, cool. So you could study me.\n\nI don't understand.\n\nMicrobiology is the study of tiny living things.\n\nI know, I'm studying it.\n\nAnd I said you could study me 'cause I'm a tiny living thing.\n\nIt's a joke.\n\nAre you sure?\n\nDo you like science-fiction?\n\nNo.\n\nRole-playing games?\n\nLike in the bedroom or like Dungeons and Dragons?\n\nEither.\n\nNo.\n\nGonna be a long night.\n\nYeah well, it's your fault.\n\nI had to ask. You didn't have to say yes.\n\nYou like magic?\n\nNot really.\n\nOkay.\n\nLong a long night.\n\nI play my endless serpent. Raj will play ecstatic frenzy, which means Larry will have to play chaos overlord.\n\nThen captain sweatpants, molten river.\n\nI play nightshade dryad. Game, set and match.\n\nNow fetch me Wil Wheaton!\n\nBot-tash bir jab-loo-di rekh kkhakkh-o ny!\n\nDid that guy just say \"revenge is a dish best served cold\" in Klingon?\n\nI believe so.\n\nWhat is wrong with him?\n\nEveryone has a different theory.\n\nHow about computers?\n\nDo you like computers?\n\nI use them. I don't like them.\n\nOkay...\n\nPuppies? Where do you stand on puppies?\n\nA puppy once bit my face.\n\nOf course it did.\n\nHow about that? Einstein was wrong.\n\nWhat?\n\nApproaching the speed of light doesn't slow down time.\n\nApproaching them does.\n\nExcuse me.\n\nOh, damn. It's my mother.\n\nAre you going to answer it?\n\nI'm torn.\n\nShe might be dying, and, you know,\n\nI wouldn't want to miss that.\n\nOn the other hand, if I let it go to voicemail, I could play it over and over.\n\nI know how you feel. My mother makes me crazy.\n\nNot as crazy as my mother makes me.\n\nOh, yeah?\n\nDoes your mother call you every day at work to see if you've had a healthy lunch?\n\nMy mother calls me at work to see if I had a healthy bowel movement.\n\nOkay, well, does she lay out your clothes for you in the morning like you're nine years old?\n\nYou live with your mother?\n\nNo. That's the sad part.\n\nOoh, rough.\n\nOkay, check this out.\n\nMy mother made me wear rubber gloves to kindergarten so I wouldn't pick up a disease from the other children.\n\nThat's nothing.\n\nI couldn't ride a bicycle 'cause my mother was afraid I'd hit a bump and lose my virginity.\n\nOh, wow.\n\nYou didn't, did you?\n\nNot on a bicycle.\n\nIn a camry.\n\nOh!\n\nCorolla!\n\nMore wine?\n\nI'd love some.\n\nListen, you have to come to Shabbat dinner at my house sometime.\n\nWhy?\n\nA catholic girl like you wearing a big cross like that might just give my mother the big brain aneurysm\n\nI've been hoping for.\n\nOkay, but only if you come to Sunday dinner at my house wearing a yarmulke.\n\nIt's a date.\n\nAm I a matchmaker or what?\n\nLava serpent.\n\nNest of snakes.\n\nUnderworld guardian.\n\nUnderworld guardian.\n\nWe skirmish to the death.\n\nInvisibility spell.\n\nLuminescence spell.\n\nWater nymph.\n\nFire demon.\n\nTwo-headed tiger.\n\nThree-headed lion.\n\nSulphur.\n\nBrimstone.\n\nProblem, Wil Wheaton?\n\nHang on.\n\nYou're holding two moderate spell cards, a small rock and a potion of Zancor, which will be about as much help as an air conditioner on the ice planet Hoth.\n\nYour only move is to play the potion, lose the skirmish, and two moves later, the game.\n\nI think he's got me.\n\nThe year was 1995.\n\nThe place: Jackson, Mississippi.\n\nHaving spent ten hours on a bus, during which I had to twice violate my personal rule against relieving myself on board a moving vehicle...\n\nI finally arrived at the fourth annual Dixie-Trek convention only to find that my idol Wil Wheaton decided he had better things to do than to show up and sign my action figure.\n\nWhat?\n\nYou betrayed me, Wil Wheaton.\n\nNow.\n\nI have my revenge.\n\nYou went to the '95 Dixie-Trek?\n\nOh, dude, my grandmother had just died, and I had to go to her funeral.\n\nYour mee-maw died?\n\nThat's terrible.\n\nYeah, it was.\n\nBut... I'm really sorry that I disappointed you.\n\nNo, no, I understand.\n\nAnything happened to my mee-maw,\n\nI'd be one inconsolable moon pie.\n\nI should clarify that statement by explaining that she calls me \"moon pie.\"\n\nIt'a special relationship, isn't it, between a boy and his grandmother?\n\nOh, yes.\n\nOkay, great, everybody loves their grandmas!\n\nNow, come on, Sheldon, finish him off!\n\nIt's okay, Sheldon.\n\nI let you down.\n\nI deserve it.\n\nPotion of Zancor.\n\nWhat are you waiting for?!\n\nKill Wil Wheaton!\n\nFrom hell's heart, stab at him!\n\nI can't.\n\nSure you can. Do it! Do it!\n\nNo.\n\nI came here to defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who destroyed my dreams.\n\nBut I can't defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who loved is mee-maw.\n\nEnchanted bunny.\n\nNo! Not enchanted bunny!\n\nI call my mee-maw \"nana\".\n\nAnd she's going be very happy to hear that my small rock kills your enchanted bunny.\n\nGame over, moon pie.\n\nI... I... I don't understand.\n\nYour grandmother's alive?\n\nOh, you catch on quick.\n\nCome on, Stewie, let's get our prize money.\n\nThat was fun.\n\nWheaton!\n\nWheaton!\n\nWheaton!\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "41c1d54d-b26b-4a55-9985-d340c0e7887a": {"__data__": {"id_": "41c1d54d-b26b-4a55-9985-d340c0e7887a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "4764ece49929bf4de0eed14507ce9241b5adac80f1ae3b509985f14f30ab7719", "text": "\n\nKites, ho!\n\nKites, ho!\n\nExcuse me.\n\nYou're misusing the word \"ho.\"\n\nIt's an interjection used to call attention to a destination, not an object, as in \"land, ho!\" or \"westward, ho!\"\n\nKites, ho!\n\nHey, guys.

These are the talking points for my NPR interview tomorrow.\n\nI need to make sure that they're simple enough for the less educated in the audience to understand.\n\nHoward, look this over and tell me what's unclear to you.\n\nExcuse me, I have a master's degree in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nIt required the completion of 144 units of grad work and an original thesis.\n\nYes.\n\nLook this over and tell  me what's unclear to you.\n\nYou know, when Sheldon gives you homework, you don't have to do it.\n\nIn fact, it's better if you don't, otherwise it makes the rest of us look bad.\n\nHi, guys.\n\nHello.\n\nYo, Raj, talk to me.\n\nI'm sorry, just screwing with you.\n\nHey, Howard, why haven't you called Bernadette?\n\nDid she say something?\n\nYeah, she said she hasn't heard from you in a week.\n\nI thought you liked her.\n\nI do, but she wants a commitment and I'm not sure she's my type.\n\nShe agreed to go out with you for free.\n\nWhat more do you need?\n\nLook, Bernadette is really nice.\n\nI just always thought when I finally settle down into a relationship, it would be with someone, you know, different.\n\nDifferent how?\n\nWell, you know, more like\n\nMegan Fox from Transformers.\n\nOr Katee Sackhoff from Battlestar Galactica.\n\nAre you high?\n\nYou'd have a better shot with the three-breasted\n\nMartian hooker from Total Recall.\n\nOkay, now you're just being unrealistic.\n\nAnyway, that movie was like 20 years ago.\n\nImagine how saggy those things would be.\n\nHoward, you're going to throw away a great girl like Bernadette because you're holding out for some ridiculous fantasy?\n\nHey, just because you settled doesn't mean I have to.\n\nExcuse me,\n\nI'm sitting here.\n\nHey, I did not settle for Leonard.\n\nI mean, obviously, he isn't the  kind of guy I usually go out with... you know, physically.\n\nAgain, I'm right here.\n\nMy point is, I do not judge a book by its cover.\n\nI am interested in the person underneath.\n\nI am here, right?\n\nYou see me.\n\nHey, I'm interested in what's inside people, too, but why is it wrong to want those insides wrapped up in, say, the delicious caramel that is Halle Berry?\n\nYes, you're delicious caramel, too.\n\nAll right, you know what,\n\nI will tell you why it's wrong...\n\nExcuse me, may I interject?\n\nWhat?\n\nBiologically speaking,\n\nHoward is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line.\n\nThank you, Sheldon.\n\nNow, whether that propagation is in the interest of humanity is, of course, an entirely different question.\n\nThis is Ira Flatow and you're listening to NPR's Science Friday.\n\nJoining us today by phone from his office in Pasadena, California is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.\n\nOh, this is going to be a riot.\n\nThanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper.\n\nMy pleasure, Ira.\n\nNow, let's talk about magnetic monopoles.\n\nCan you explain to our audience just what a monopole is?\n\nOf course.\n\nFirst, consider an ordinary magnet which has, as even the most uneducated in your audience must know, two poles.\n\nA north and south pole.\n\nIf you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole.\n\nUh, Dr. Cooper,\n\nI think there might be something wrong with our connection.\n\nNo, I hear you fine.\n\nAs I was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles.\n\nThe primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole. of such monopoles. in search of said particles.\n\nI'm going to kill you!\n\nSo nice you could join me this evening.\n\nYou're looking lovely as always. {\\pos(192,220)}Thanks, Howard. {\\pos(192,220)}Always nice to be part of your masturbatory fantasies. {\\pos(192,220)}Come on, Katee. {\\pos(192,220)}Don't make it sound so cheap.\n\nI'm sorry, fiddling with yourself in the bathtub is a real class act.\n\nThank you.\n\nSo, shall we get started?\n\nSure.\n\nBut can I ask you a question first?\n\nDo you want to play\n\nCylon and colonist?\n\nNo.\n\nI want to know why you're playing make-believe with me when you could be out with a real woman tonight.\n\nYou mean, Bernadette?\n\nNo, I mean Princess Leia.\n\nOf course\n\nI mean Bernadette.\n\nShe's a wonderful girl and she really likes you.\n\nI know, but she's not you.\n\nI'm not me.\n\nThe real me is in Beverly Hills going out with a tall, handsome, rich guy.\n\nReally? Tall?\n\nSix-four.\n\nOuch.\n\nThe point is, you've got a wonderful girl in your life, and you're ignoring her in order to spend your nights in the bathtub with a mental image and a wash cloth.\n\nHoward!\n\nWhat are you doing in there?\n\nI'm taking a bath!\n\nI hope that's all you're doing!\n\nWe share that tub!\n\nDon't remind me!\n\nOh, man.\n\nAll soaped up and no place to go.\n\nHow ya doin', buddy?\n\nI was humiliated on national radio.\n\nHow do you think I'm doing?\n\nCome on, it wasn't that bad.\n\nWhat do you want?\n\nWe represent the Lollipop Guild, and we want you.\n\nOkay, so Kripke played a joke on you.\n\nIt wasn't funny.\n\nI thought it was funny.\n\nRaj.\n\nYou laughed.\n\nDid you laugh?\n\nI fell on the floor.\n\nAll right, he got you.\n\nYou can get him back.\n\nI refuse to sink to his level.\n\nYou can't sink.\n\nWith all that helium in you, you're lucky you  don't float away.\n\nAre you really admitting defeat?\n\nI never admit defeat.\n\nGood.\n\nHowever, on an unrelated topic,\n\nI am never getting out of this bed again.\n\nWhat if you could make Kripke look even sillier than he made you look?\n\nI don't think that's possible, dude.\n\nYou're not helping.\n\nI didn't come to help,\n\nI came to mock.\n\nSheldon, what you need to do is figure out a way to exact vengeance on Kripke, like, uh, like, how the Joker got back at Batman for putting him in the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane.\n\nThat's true. He didn't just stay there and talk about his feelings with the other psychotic villains.\n\nHe, he broke out and poisoned\n\nGotham's water supply.\n\nWell...\n\nI suppose I could poison Kripke.\n\nNo!\n\nNo.\n\nIt's a simple matter.\n\nThere are several toxic chemicals that'd be untraceable in an autopsy.\n\nOkay, uh, that's the spirit, but, um, let's dial it back to a non-lethal form of vengeance.\n\nOh!\n\nHow about we put a whoopee  cushion on his office chair?\n\nHe'll sit down, it'll sound like he's flatulent, even though he's not.\n\nLet's keep thinking.\n\nOh, gee, you're too late.\n\nScarlett Johansson and\n\nWonder Woman were just in here trolling around for neurotic, little weasels.\n\nI came to talk to Bernadette.\n\nShe's working today, right?\n\nYes, but I don't think she wants to see you.\n\nWhy not?\n\nCome on, Howard.\n\nYou hurt her feelings by not calling her all week.\n\nPlus, I've kind of been talkin' some smack about ya.\n\nHello, Howard.\n\nWait, Bernadette,\n\nI need to talk to you.\n\nI can't now, I'm working.\n\nThis will only take a second.\n\nYou asked me to think about where our relationship was going, and I did.\n\nBernadette?\n\nWill you marry me?\n\nIs this more comedy that I don't understand?\n\nNo. I'm serious.\n\nI'm never going to find another girl like you who likes me and is, you know, real.\n\nSo, this isn't a joke?\n\nNo.\n\nThen you're insane.\n\nI prefer to think of myself as quirky.\n\nHoward, we've only been on three dates.\n\nWe haven't even had sex yet.\n\nFair enough.\n\nWhen's your break?\n\nWow.\n\nDon't you just hate it when this happens?\n\nWow.\n\nAll right, how's this for revenge?\n\nA solution of hydrogen peroxide, and one of saturated potassium iodide.\n\nWhat's this?\n\nMountain Dew.\n\nAhh, refreshing.\n\nNow, we're going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap, creating a little exothermic release of oxygen.\n\nFoamy vengeance.\n\nYes, exactly.\n\nThis is brilliant, Sheldon.\n\nHow are we going to deploy it in Kripke's office?\n\nAlready taken care of.\n\nObserve.\n\nThis is a live shot of Kripke's lab via a mini webcam I was able to install, thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed in the night janitor's shirt pocket.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nI also secured large quantities of these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling.\n\nOh, Sheldon, you remind me of a young Lex Luthor.\n\nYou flatter me, sir.\n\nLet me guess: motion sensors?\n\nYes.\n\nThe reaction will be triggered when Kripke reaches the center of the room.\n\nMwah, ha, ha.\n\nI gotta say,\n\nI am really impressed.\n\nThis is truly the Sheldon Cooper way to get even.\n\nIt may be low-tech, but I still maintain the whoopee cushion has comic validity.\n\nHere comes Kripke!\n\nWho is that with him?\n\nI believe that's the president of the university.\n\nAnd the board of directors.\n\nAbort! Abort!\n\nThere is no \"abort\".\n\nHow could you not put in an \"abort?\"\n\nI made a boo-boo, all right?\n\nI think the board will really appreciate how well we're using that\n\nNSA grant, President Seibert.\n\nRight here we have a micro-controlled plasma...\n\nWow. Looks like the\n\nGanges on laundry day.\n\nAt least they don't know it was you.\n\nHello, Kripke.\n\nThis classic prank comes to you from the malevolent mind of Sheldon Cooper.\n\nIf you'd like to see the look on your stupid face, this video is being instantly uploaded to YouTube.\n\nOh, and a hat tip to Leonard Hofstadter and Raj Koothrappali for their support and encouragement in this enterprise.\n\nWell, I'm going back to India.\n\nWhat's your plan?\n\nHey, here's your tip from table seven.\n\nOh, thanks.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nTesting. Check. {\\pos(192,220)}Check two. {\\pos(192,220)}Oh, now what? {\\pos(192,220)}You want me to throw him out? {\\pos(192,220)}No, that's okay. {\\pos(192,220)}Are you sure? He's small.\n\nI bet I can get a nice, tight spiral on him.\n\nI want to dedicate this number to a great gal who I've done wrong. \u266a Bernadette \u266a \u266a I am so sorry for \u266a \u266a trying to propose to you \u266a \u266a Bernadette \u266a \u266a You found it creepy \u266a \u266a but that's just the kind of thing I do \u266a \u266a Ahh... \u266a \u266a I know now it was too soon to talk of love \u266a \u266a It was just a crazy idea that came to me in my tub \u266a \u266a But, Bernadette, give me one more chance \u266a \u266a Sweet Bernadette \u266a \u266a I'll get the hang of this thing \u266a \u266a They call romance,\n\nSweet Bernadette \u266a \u266a I dream to once again \u266a \u266a Kiss your lips,\n\nSweet Bernadette \u266a \u266a Sincerely yours \u266a \u266a Howard Wolowitz \u266a \u266a Bernadette... \u266a\n\nOh, I am so sorry.\n\nAre you kidding?\n\nThat's the most romantic thing anyone's ever done for me. \u266a Bernadette! \u266a\n\nThank you, Cheesecake Factory!\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "443d80f3-4be6-462e-bb67-e101cce00005": {"__data__": {"id_": "443d80f3-4be6-462e-bb67-e101cce00005", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "e22577cbb8e3919e3031ef6c3dc61409ff97b9b28ed786a68006fb14fae6789a", "text": "\n\nHey, Leonard, check this out.\n\nLeonard, she's doing it again.\n\nI think it upsets Sheldon when you play with the food.\n\nNo.\n\nIt upsets Sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it from the containers without regard for its equitable distribution.\n\nThis is essentially why you have famine in India.\n\nYou want me to put it back?\n\nLeonard.\n\nIt upsets Sheldon when you play with the Sheldon.\n\nWhat's up, my nerdizzles?\n\nRaj, Sheldon,\n\nI want you to meet my girlfriend Bernadette.\n\nHello.

Hey.\n\nBernadette, say fo'shizzle to my nerdizzles.\n\nI don't think I can.\n\nI don't have Howard's street cred.\n\nI hope it's all right-\n\nI told my girlfriend Bernadette she could join us for dinner.\n\nSure. The more, the merrier.\n\nWa- no, that's a false equivalency.\n\nMore does not equal merry.\n\nIf there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating?\n\nNo, we'd be suffocating.\n\nSheldon...\n\nDon't \"Sheldon\" me.\n\nWe ordered for five people, not six.\n\nOh, come on, it's fine.\n\nWe'll just put it all on the table, you know, family style.\n\nOh, sure. And while we're at it, why don't we put our hands behind our backs, have an old-fashioned eating contest?\n\nRelax, it'll be fine.\n\nSit down, you guys.\n\nNo! No! No!\n\nWhat?!\n\nOh, yeah, you can't sit there.\n\nWhy not?\n\nThat's where Sheldon sits.\n\nHe can't sit somewhere else?\n\nNo, no, no- you see, in the winter, that seat is close enough to the radiator so that he's warm, yet not so close that he sweats.\n\nIn the summer, it's directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there.\n\nIt faces the television at an angle that isn't direct, so he can still talk to everybody, yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted.\n\nPerhaps there's hope for you after all.\n\nOoh, I love your shoes.\n\nOh, thanks.\n\nThey are cute, aren't they?\n\nWhere'd you get them? Shoes for Less.\n\nI've been meaning to go over there.\n\nOh, great selection, great prices.\n\nMy mother was right. Hell is real.\n\nCome on, Sheldon.\n\nLet the womenfolk chat.\n\nWomenfolk?\n\nGals?\n\nChicks?\n\nUtero-Americans?\n\nJust eat your dinner.\n\nDon't take him too seriously.\n\nA lot of what he says is intended as humor.\n\nYeah, well, I don't think it's very funny.\n\nMe neither, but he just lights up when I laugh.\n\nHoward, never let her go.\n\nSo, Leonard, Howard says you're working on fundamental tests of quantum mechanics.\n\nI am.\n\nAre you interested in physics?\n\nOh, I find it fascinating.\n\nIf I hadn't gone into microbiology,\n\nI probably would have gone into physics.\n\nOr ice dancing.\n\nActually, my tests of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point.\n\nRight now, we're testing the phase shift due to an electric potential.\n\nThat's amazing.\n\nSHELDON Yes.\n\nLeonard's work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels.\n\nWhile I appreciate the \"Oh, snap,\"\n\nI'm uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear.\n\nAre you going to try to set up the voltages using tunnel junctions?\n\nYes, I am.\n\nYou want to see a simulation on my laptop?\n\nOh, yeah, show me.\n\nIn microbiology, the most exciting thing\n\nI get to work with is yeast.\n\nHoward?\n\nYeah?\n\nYour shoes are delightful.\n\nWhere did you get them?\n\nWhat?\n\nBazinga. I don't care.\n\nHa! Eat my dust, racially stereotypical plumber.\n\nThat's not fair.\n\nI got stuck behind a tree.\n\nAnd a cow and a penguin.\n\nFace it, dude, whether it's a real car or a virtual cartoon car, you can't drive.\n\nJust need a little more practice.\n\nWhat you need is cheat codes, motor skills and a magic genie who grants wishes to little boys who suck at Mario Kart.\n\nHey, Sheldon, can I talk to you for a second?\n\nIt's not about shoes, is it?\n\nI don't think I could go through that again.\n\nIt's not about shoes.\n\nThen speak.\n\nUm, actually, can we do it in private?\n\nAll right.\n\nGo away.\n\nI agree, it's rude, but she asked for privacy.\n\nThanks, Raj.\n\nOkay, so here's the thing:\n\nI was wondering if you could maybe teach me a little physics?\n\nA little physics?\n\nThere's no such thing.\n\nPhysics encompasses the entire universe, from quantum particles to supernovas, from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies.\n\nYeah, okay, cool.\n\nI don't need the PBS special.\n\nI just want to know enough so I can talk to Leonard about his job.\n\nYou know, like Bernadette does.\n\nWhy can't Leonard teach you? 'Cause I want to surprise him.\n\nCan't you surprise him in some other way?\n\nFor example, I'm sure he'd be delightfully taken aback if you cleaned your apartment.\n\nCome on, Sheldon, this is important to me.\n\nPenny, this would be a massive undertaking, and my time is both limited and valuable.\n\nYou're sitting here playing video games all day.\n\nOkay, point.\n\nWhat sort of foundation do you have?\n\nDid you take any science classes in school?\n\nSure. I did the one with the frogs.\n\nThe one with the frogs.\n\nYeah, actually, it was pretty cool.\n\nA lot of the girls threw up, but I gutted that thing like a deer.\n\nI'm sorry, Penny.\n\nI don't think so.\n\nOh, come on!\n\nA smart guy like you, it'll be a challenge.\n\nYou can make it like an experiment.\n\nInteresting.\n\nI suppose if someone could teach sign language to KoKo the gorilla...\n\nI could teach you some rudimentary physics.\n\nGreat!\n\nIt's a little insulting, but great.\n\nI'll be KoKo.\n\nNot likely.\n\nKoKo learned to understand over 2,000 words, not one of which had anything to do with shoes.\n\nHey, fellas.\n\nThis is my girlfriend Bernadette.\n\nMy girlfriend Bernadette.\n\nWho are all those people?\n\nHave no idea.\n\nHey, Leonard.\n\nHi. Hey, look, it's Howard and his girlfriend Bernadette.\n\nThought I'd give the little woman a tour of the old salt mines.\n\nHe doesn't mean salt mines.\n\nHe means where he works.\n\nYeah, no, I got it.\n\nSo, how's your experiment going?\n\nAh, terrific.\n\nWe're getting the electron accelerator set up.\n\nWe should be ready to go day after tomorrow.\n\nBoy, I'd love to see that.\n\nYou're welcome to come.\n\nReally? Oh, that'd be great.\n\nHow exciting is that?\n\nLike Hanukkah in July.\n\nDo they have that?\n\nNo.\n\nOh.\n\nYou got me again.\n\nThis isn't non-fat yogurt.\n\nThis is fatty fat fat.\n\nExcuse me.\n\nCould you grab me another napkin, sweetie?\n\nSure. Thanks, honey.\n\nAll right, what is your deal?\n\nExcuse me?\n\nInviting my girlfriend to come see your electron accelerator?\n\nYeah? So?\n\nWow!\n\nYou really are a piece of work.\n\nIt's not enough you get the prom queen, you have to get the head of the decorating committee, too?\n\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nDon't play innocent with me.\n\nI practically invented using fancy lab equipment to seduce women.\n\nHas it ever worked?\n\nNot so far, but that's not the point!\n\nHoward, relax.\n\nI'm not interested in your girlfriend.\n\nI hope not.\n\nBecause you don't want to mess with me.\n\nI'm crazy.\n\nI believe you.\n\nResearch journal, entry one.\n\nI'm about to embark on one of the great challenges of my scientific career: teaching Penny physics.\n\nI'm calling it Project Gorilla.\n\nHey, Sheldon.\n\nCome in. Take a seat.\n\nSubject has arrived.\n\nI've extended a friendly casual greeting.\n\nReady to get started?\n\nOne moment.\n\nSubject appears well-rested and enthusiastic.\n\nApparently, ignorance is bliss.\n\nAll right, let us begin.\n\nWhere's your notebook?\n\nUm, I don't have one.\n\nHow are you going to take notes without a notebook?\n\nI have to take notes?\n\nHow else are you gonna study for the tests?\n\nThere's gonna be a test?\n\nTest-sss.\n\nHere.\n\nIt's college-ruled.\n\nI hope that's not too intimidating.\n\nThank you.\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nNow, Introduction to Physics.\n\nWhat is physics?\n\nPhysics comes from the ancient Greek word \"physika. \"\n\nIt's at this point that you'll want to start taking notes. \"Physika\" means the science of natural things.\n\nAnd it is there, in ancient Greece, that our story begins.\n\nAncient Greece?! Hush.\n\nIf you have questions, raise your hand.\n\nIt's a warm summer evening, circa 600 BC.\n\nYou've finished your shopping at the local market, or agora... ...and you look up at the night sky.\n\nThere you notice some of the stars seem to move, so you name them \"planetes,\" or \"wanderer. \"\n\nYes, Penny?\n\nUm, does this have anything to do with Leonard's work?\n\nThis is the beginning of a 2,600-year journey we're going to take together from the ancient Greeks through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr to Erwin Schrodinger to the Dutch researchers that Leonard is currently ripping off.\n\nYeah, give or take.\n\nAs I was saying, it's a warm summer evening in ancient Greece...\n\nYes, Penny?\n\nI have to go to the bathroom.\n\nCan't you hold it?\n\nNot for 2,600 years.\n\nProject Gorilla, entry two.\n\nI am exhausted.\n\nHoward? Huh?\n\nIt unhooks in the front.\n\nOh, that explains a lot.\n\nHoward, I'm home!\n\nOf course.\n\nSenior fitness was cancelled.\n\nIt turns out you can forget how to ride a bike.\n\nI'm fine, but, oy, did Sam Harpootian eat gravel.\n\nThat's great, Ma!\n\nWhat's great about an 80-year-old Armenian man with half his chin scraped off?!\n\nI guess I should go.\n\nNo, no, don't move.\n\nHey, Ma, can I have lamb stew for dinner?\n\nLamb stew? I'd have to go to the supermarket.\n\nPlease?\n\nI got a real hankering.\n\nOh, I can't say no to my little tushy face.\n\nI'll be back soon.\n\nThanks, Ma.\n\nDo you want the regular peas or the Le Seur?\n\nAlways Le Seur peas with lamb stew!\n\nYou're right! When you're right, you're right!\n\nWhat if they're out of the Le Seur?\n\nThen get the regular!\n\nAll right! You don't have to yell!\n\nSorry about that.\n\nLet me just put that on vibrate.\n\nI'm already on vibrate.\n\nYou know, that one I got.\n\nHoward, did you say something to Leonard about me?\n\nUh, what do you mean?\n\nHe says if I go see his experiment tomorrow it might weird you out.\n\nReally? He said that?\n\nYou're not jealous of Leonard, are you?\n\nMe? No.\n\nI may have mentioned that it's a little inappropriate to be asking another man's girlfriend to his experiment without first discussing it with said man.\n\nAre you saying I need to ask your permission to hang out with Leonard?\n\nI didn't say anything like that.\n\nI said Leonard has to ask my permission.\n\nCome on, I don't want to eat lamb stew with my mother.\n\nDamn, I was this close on the bra.\n\nNow, remember, Newton realized that Aristotle was wrong and force was not necessary to maintain motion.\n\nSo let's plug in our 9.8 meters per second squared as \"A\" and we get force- Earth gravity- equals mass times 9.8 meters per second per second.\n\nSo we can see that \"ma\" equals \"mg\" and what do we know from this?\n\nUh, we know that... ...Newton was a really smart cookie.\n\nOh! Is that where Fig Newtons come from?\n\nNo, Fig Newtons are named after a small town in Massachusetts.\n\nDon't write that down! Sorry.\n\nNow, if \"ma\" equals \"mg,\" what does that imply?\n\nI don't know.\n\nHow can you not know?\n\nI just told you.\n\nHave you suffered a recent blow to the head?\n\nHey!

That's it?\n\nWell, that doesn't sound so complicated.\n\nIt's not.\n\nThat's why Leonard does it.\n\nOkay, I just have one question.\n\nWhat exactly are sub-atomic particles?\n\nA good question.\n\nThank you.\n\nAnd to answer it, we first must ask ourselves: \"What is physics?\"\n\nOh, balls.\n\nIt's a warm summer evening in ancient Greece...\n\nOkay, I got a bone to pick with you.\n\nWhat did I do now?\n\nI was in bed with Bernadette, and you text-blocked me.\n\nWhat?!\n\nWe were completely naked, about to devour each other when, you text her that I have a problem with her hanging out with you.\n\nYou do have a problem with her hanging out with me.\n\nYeah, but that's not what you tell her.\n\nWhat was I supposed to tell her?\n\nI don't know; something that doesn't make me come off as a petty, jealous douche.\n\nAnd what would that be?\n\nCome on, do I have to think of everything?\n\nHey, Leonard.\n\nAm I too late to see the experiment?\n\nOh, hi. Hi.\n\nWhat are you doing here?\n\nSame thing you're doing here.\n\nI came to see Leonard's experiment.\n\nNo, you didn't.\n\nYou said Leonard's experiment was stupid.\n\nYou told her my experiment was stupid?\n\nI was just repeating what Sheldon said.\n\nLet's not get off topic.\n\nBernadette, I need to apologize.\n\nI was wrong to tell you who you should be friends with.\n\nShould I, um, leave you two alone?\n\nNo, Leonard, you should hear this.\n\nOkay, good, 'cause I wasn't really gonna go.\n\nLook, I know I come off as confident and worldly, but... the truth is I'm not.\n\nWe're shocked.\n\nWhich is why I tend to feel threatened by other guys.\n\nOr loud noises, clowns and nuns.\n\nBut I now realize how foolish that is.\n\nHe had a panic attack once when he got his head stuck in a sweater.\n\nIt was a full turtleneck.\n\nWhy aren't you helping me?\n\nI don't know.\n\nMaybe because I'm... crazy?!\n\nBernadette, please, I'm asking you to give me another chance.\n\nWhat do you think, Leonard?\n\nShould I give him another chance?\n\nIt's up to you.\n\nHe didn't call your experiment stupid.\n\nCome here, tushy face. \"Tushy face. \"\n\nRaj, you should've seen Leonard's experiment.\n\nThe interference pattern was so cool when the electron beam was on.\n\nGlad you enjoyed it.\n\nMost people aren't that interested in what I do.\n\nActually, that's not true, Leonard.\n\nIn fact, recently I've been thinking that given the parameters of your experiment, the transport of electrons through the aperture of the nano-fabricated metal rings is qualitatively no different than the experiment already conducted in the Netherlands.\n\nTheir observed phase shift in the diffusing electrons inside the metal ring already conclusively demonstrated the electric analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum-interference effect.\n\nThat's it.

The more, the merrier.\n\nWa- no, that's a false equivalency.\n\nMore does not equal merry.\n\nIf there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating?\n\nNo, we'd be suffocating.\n\nSheldon...\n\nDon't \"Sheldon\" me.\n\nWe ordered for five people, not six.\n\nOh, come on, it's fine.\n\nWe'll just put it all on the table, you know, family style.\n\nOh, sure. And while we're at it, why don't we put our hands behind our backs, have an old-fashioned eating contest?\n\nRelax, it'll be fine.\n\nSit down, you guys.\n\nNo! No! No!\n\nWhat?!\n\nOh, yeah, you can't sit there.\n\nWhy not?\n\nThat's where Sheldon sits.\n\nHe can't sit somewhere else?\n\nNo, no, no- you see, in the winter, that seat is close enough to the radiator so that he's warm, yet not so close that he sweats.\n\nIn the summer, it's directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there.\n\nIt faces the television at an angle that isn't direct, so he can still talk to everybody, yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted.\n\nPerhaps there's hope for you after all.\n\nOoh, I love your shoes.\n\nOh, thanks.\n\nThey are cute, aren't they?\n\nWhere'd you get them? Shoes for Less.\n\nI've been meaning to go over there.\n\nOh, great selection, great prices.\n\nMy mother was right.

I don't care.\n\nHa! Eat my dust, racially stereotypical plumber.\n\nThat's not fair.\n\nI got stuck behind a tree.\n\nAnd a cow and a penguin.\n\nFace it, dude, whether it's a real car or a virtual cartoon car, you can't drive.\n\nJust need a little more practice.\n\nWhat you need is cheat codes, motor skills and a magic genie who grants wishes to little boys who suck at Mario Kart.\n\nHey, Sheldon, can I talk to you for a second?\n\nIt's not about shoes, is it?\n\nI don't think I could go through that again.\n\nIt's not about shoes.\n\nThen speak.\n\nUm, actually, can we do it in private?\n\nAll right.\n\nGo away.\n\nI agree, it's rude, but she asked for privacy.\n\nThanks, Raj.\n\nOkay, so here's the thing:\n\nI was wondering if you could maybe teach me a little physics?\n\nA little physics?\n\nThere's no such thing.\n\nPhysics encompasses the entire universe, from quantum particles to supernovas, from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies.\n\nYeah, okay, cool.\n\nI don't need the PBS special.\n\nI just want to know enough so I can talk to Leonard about his job.\n\nYou know, like Bernadette does.\n\nWhy can't Leonard teach you? 'Cause I want to surprise him.\n\nCan't you surprise him in some other way?\n\nFor example, I'm sure he'd be delightfully taken aback if you cleaned your apartment.\n\nCome on, Sheldon, this is important to me.\n\nPenny, this would be a massive undertaking, and my time is both limited and valuable.\n\nYou're sitting here playing video games all day.\n\nOkay, point.\n\nWhat sort of foundation do you have?\n\nDid you take any science classes in school?\n\nSure. I did the one with the frogs.\n\nThe one with the frogs.\n\nYeah, actually, it was pretty cool.\n\nA lot of the girls threw up, but I gutted that thing like a deer.\n\nI'm sorry, Penny.\n\nI don't think so.\n\nOh, come on!\n\nA smart guy like you, it'll be a challenge.\n\nYou can make it like an experiment.\n\nInteresting.\n\nI suppose if someone could teach sign language to KoKo the gorilla...\n\nI could teach you some rudimentary physics.\n\nGreat!\n\nIt's a little insulting, but great.\n\nI'll be KoKo.\n\nNot likely.\n\nKoKo learned to understand over 2,000 words, not one of which had anything to do with shoes.\n\nHey, fellas.\n\nThis is my girlfriend Bernadette.\n\nMy girlfriend Bernadette.\n\nWho are all those people?\n\nHave no idea.\n\nHey, Leonard.\n\nHi. Hey, look, it's Howard and his girlfriend Bernadette.\n\nThought I'd give the little woman a tour of the old salt mines.\n\nHe doesn't mean salt mines.\n\nHe means where he works.\n\nYeah, no, I got it.\n\nSo, how's your experiment going?\n\nAh, terrific.\n\nWe're getting the electron accelerator set up.\n\nWe should be ready to go day after tomorrow.\n\nBoy, I'd love to see that.\n\nYou're welcome to come.\n\nReally? Oh, that'd be great.\n\nHow exciting is that?\n\nLike Hanukkah in July.\n\nDo they have that?\n\nNo.\n\nOh.\n\nYou got me again.\n\nThis isn't non-fat yogurt.\n\nThis is fatty fat fat.\n\nExcuse me.\n\nCould you grab me another napkin, sweetie?\n\nSure. Thanks, honey.\n\nAll right, what is your deal?\n\nExcuse me?\n\nInviting my girlfriend to come see your electron accelerator?\n\nYeah? So?\n\nWow!\n\nYou really are a piece of work.\n\nIt's not enough you get the prom queen, you have to get the head of the decorating committee, too?\n\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nDon't play innocent with me.\n\nI practically invented using fancy lab equipment to seduce women.\n\nHas it ever worked?\n\nNot so far, but that's not the point!\n\nHoward, relax.\n\nI'm not interested in your girlfriend.\n\nI hope not.\n\nBecause you don't want to mess with me.\n\nI'm crazy.\n\nI believe you.\n\nResearch journal, entry one.\n\nI'm about to embark on one of the great challenges of my scientific career: teaching Penny physics.\n\nI'm calling it Project Gorilla.\n\nHey, Sheldon.\n\nCome in. Take a seat.\n\nSubject has arrived.\n\nI've extended a friendly casual greeting.\n\nReady to get started?\n\nOne moment.\n\nSubject appears well-rested and enthusiastic.\n\nApparently, ignorance is bliss.\n\nAll right, let us begin.\n\nWhere's your notebook?\n\nUm, I don't have one.\n\nHow are you going to take notes without a notebook?\n\nI have to take notes?\n\nHow else are you gonna study for the tests?\n\nThere's gonna be a test?\n\nTest-sss.\n\nHere.\n\nIt's college-ruled.\n\nI hope that's not too intimidating.\n\nThank you.\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nNow, Introduction to Physics.\n\nWhat is physics?\n\nPhysics comes from the ancient Greek word \"physika. \"\n\nIt's at this point that you'll want to start taking notes. \"Physika\" means the science of natural things.\n\nAnd it is there, in ancient Greece, that our story begins.\n\nAncient Greece?! Hush.\n\nIf you have questions, raise your hand.\n\nIt's a warm summer evening, circa 600 BC.\n\nYou've finished your shopping at the local market, or agora... ...and you look up at the night sky.\n\nThere you notice some of the stars seem to move, so you name them \"planetes,\" or \"wanderer. \"\n\nYes, Penny?\n\nUm, does this have anything to do with Leonard's work?\n\nThis is the beginning of a 2,600-year journey we're going to take together from the ancient Greeks through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr to Erwin Schrodinger to the Dutch researchers that Leonard is currently ripping off.\n\nYeah, give or take.\n\nAs I was saying, it's a warm summer evening in ancient Greece...\n\nYes, Penny?\n\nI have to go to the bathroom.\n\nCan't you hold it?\n\nNot for 2,600 years.\n\nProject Gorilla, entry two.\n\nI am exhausted.\n\nHoward? Huh?\n\nIt unhooks in the front.\n\nOh, that explains a lot.\n\nHoward, I'm home!\n\nOf course.\n\nSenior fitness was cancelled.\n\nIt turns out you can forget how to ride a bike.\n\nI'm fine, but, oy, did Sam Harpootian eat gravel.\n\nThat's great, Ma!\n\nWhat's great about an 80-year-old Armenian man with half his chin scraped off?!\n\nI guess I should go.\n\nNo, no, don't move.\n\nHey, Ma, can I have lamb stew for dinner?\n\nLamb stew? I'd have to go to the supermarket.\n\nPlease?\n\nI got a real hankering.\n\nOh, I can't say no to my little tushy face.\n\nI'll be back soon.\n\nThanks, Ma.\n\nDo you want the regular peas or the Le Seur?\n\nAlways Le Seur peas with lamb stew!\n\nYou're right! When you're right, you're right!\n\nWhat if they're out of the Le Seur?\n\nThen get the regular!\n\nAll right! You don't have to yell!\n\nSorry about that.\n\nLet me just put that on vibrate.\n\nI'm already on vibrate.\n\nYou know, that one I got.\n\nHoward, did you say something to Leonard about me?\n\nUh, what do you mean?\n\nHe says if I go see his experiment tomorrow it might weird you out.\n\nReally? He said that?\n\nYou're not jealous of Leonard, are you?\n\nMe? No.\n\nI may have mentioned that it's a little inappropriate to be asking another man's girlfriend to his experiment without first discussing it with said man.\n\nAre you saying I need to ask your permission to hang out with Leonard?\n\nI didn't say anything like that.\n\nI said Leonard has to ask my permission.\n\nCome on, I don't want to eat lamb stew with my mother.\n\nDamn, I was this close on the bra.\n\nNow, remember, Newton realized that Aristotle was wrong and force was not necessary to maintain motion.\n\nSo let's plug in our 9.8 meters per second squared as \"A\" and we get force- Earth gravity- equals mass times 9.8 meters per second per second.\n\nSo we can see that \"ma\" equals \"mg\" and what do we know from this?\n\nUh, we know that... ...Newton was a really smart cookie.\n\nOh! Is that where Fig Newtons come from?\n\nNo, Fig Newtons are named after a small town in Massachusetts.\n\nDon't write that down! Sorry.\n\nNow, if \"ma\" equals \"mg,\" what does that imply?\n\nI don't know.\n\nHow can you not know?\n\nI just told you.\n\nHave you suffered a recent blow to the head?\n\nHey! You don't have to be so mean!\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nHave you suffered a recent blow to the head?\n\nNo, you just suck at teaching. Really?\n\nOf those two explanations, which one seems the most likely?\n\nOh, God...\n\nSheldon, I'm trying to understand, but you're going too fast.\n\nCan you just back up a little bit?\n\nAll right.\n\nIt's a warm summer evening in ancient Greece...\n\nNot that far back!\n\nOkay!\n\nAt what point did you begin to feel lost?\n\nI don't know.\n\nWhere were we looking up at the night sky?\n\nGreece. Damn it!\n\nThere's no need to get frustrated.\n\nPeople learn at different rates.\n\nUnlike objects falling in a vacuum, which...? \"ma\" equals \"mg\"...?\n\nSquared?\n\nNo.\n\nAristotle?\n\nNo.\n\nFive?\n\nOh!\n\nThen I don't know.\n\nWhy are you crying?\n\nBecause I'm stupid!\n\nThat's no reason to cry.\n\nOne cries because one is sad.\n\nFor example, I cry because others are stupid and it makes me sad.\n\nOkay, look, can we just please forget about all this extra stuff and can you just tell me what Leonard does?\n\nAll right.\n\nLeonard is attempting to learn why sub-atomic particles move the way they do.\n\nReally? That's it?\n\nWell, that doesn't sound so complicated.\n\nIt's not.\n\nThat's why Leonard does it.\n\nOkay, I just have one question.\n\nWhat exactly are sub-atomic particles?\n\nA good question.\n\nThank you.\n\nAnd to answer it, we first must ask ourselves: \"What is physics?\"\n\nOh, balls.\n\nIt's a warm summer evening in ancient Greece...\n\nOkay, I got a bone to pick with you.\n\nWhat did I do now?\n\nI was in bed with Bernadette, and you text-blocked me.\n\nWhat?!\n\nWe were completely naked, about to devour each other when, you text her that I have a problem with her hanging out with you.\n\nYou do have a problem with her hanging out with me.\n\nYeah, but that's not what you tell her.\n\nWhat was I supposed to tell her?\n\nI don't know; something that doesn't make me come off as a petty, jealous douche.\n\nAnd what would that be?\n\nCome on, do I have to think of everything?\n\nHey, Leonard.\n\nAm I too late to see the experiment?\n\nOh, hi.

Did you have a Christmas tree?\n\nOh,yes.\n\nWe had a tree,we had a manger, we had an inflatable Santa Claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn.\n\nAnd to make things even more jolly,there were so many blinking lights on the house they induced neighborhood-wide seizures.\n\nSo I take it you don't want to help us trim the tree.\n\nI do not.But if you insist on decorating a spider-infested fire hazard in my home\n\nI would request that you add this.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nYou're kidding,right?\n\nIt's a bust of Sir Isaac Newton.\n\nOh,sure,sure. Very Christmasy.\n\nWait,excuse me, but it's much more \"Christmasy\" than anything you've put on the tree.\n\nHere we go.\n\nDecember 25,1642, Julian calendar, Sir Isaac Newton is born.\n\nJesus,on the other hand, was actually born in the summer--\n\nHis birthday was moved to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday that celebrated the winter solstice with lit fires and slaughtered goats.\n\nWhich,frankly, sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother followed by a fruitcake.\n\nMerry Newton-mas,everyone.\n\nI sense that's not sincere, although I have no idea why.\n\nNo,it's fine. Look,Sir Issac can go right next to this little candy cane.\n\nNo. Isaac goes at the top of the tree.\n\nNo,he doesn't.\n\nI understand. You dispute Newton's claim that he invented calculus and you want to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top.\n\nYeah,you got me. I'm a Leibniz man.\n\nWell,perhaps when your mother gets here, she'll talk some sense into you.\n\nWhat? Your-your mother's coming? When?\n\nTomorrow.\n\nWhen were you going to tell me? - tomorrow?\n\nWhy were you keeping this a secret?\n\nWell,I just-- I thought... - If I can interject here, obviously Leonard is concerned that his mother won't approve of you as his mate.\n\nWhy wouldn't she approve of me? I'm adorable.\n\nYou are,it's just... - If I can interject again.\n\nLeonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family, who have all chosen high-achieving partners.\n\nHe probably feels that it's doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement is memorizing the Cheesecake Factory menu.\n\nHey,it's a big menu.\n\nThere's two pages just for desserts.\n\nI know. And those specials-- they change every day.\n\nOkay,you know what? It's lame when I say it.\n\nIt's just ridiculous when you pile on. - Okay. Sorry.\n\nSo what did she say when you told her we were going out?\n\nYou didn't tell her we were going out,did you?\n\nWhy not?\n\nLeonard...I'm no expert on meditation, but if you're trying to calm yourself down,\n\nI believe the word is \"Om.\"\n\nIt was so nice of you to come all the way down to the airport to pick me up.\n\nNo trouble at all.\n\nI drove,Mother.\n\nI'm driving now.\n\nYes,dear. Mommy's proud.\n\nI've been meaning to thank you for your notes on my paper disproving quantum brain dynamic theory.\n\nMy pleasure.For a non-physicist, you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipoles in the brain's water molecules could not possibly form a Bose condensate.\n\nWait,wait,wait. When did you send my mom notes on a paper?\n\nAugust 16.\n\nRight after her carpal tunnel surgery.\n\nOh,did I thank you for the flowers? - You did.\n\nI don't really like flowers.\n\nNeither do I,but it's the social convention. - It is,isn't it?\n\nWait,wait,wait. You had surgery?\n\nYes,and Sheldon sent me flowers.\n\nNo,I heard that. - Then what was all that \"wait,wait,wait\" about?\n\nI just don't understand why he knows more about your life than I do.\n\nWell,I would assume it's because Sheldon and I stay in touch due to mutual interest and respect, while you avoid me, due to unresolved childhood issues.\n\nIt's what we think caused your narcissistic personality disorder.\n\nWe discussed it at length during our last video chat.\n\nAlthough how we got onto the subject of you is baffling.\n\nYes,but we are on the subject, so I'm obliged to ask.\n\nLeonard,how are you?\n\nFine,Mom. How are you?\n\nMmm,menopausal.\n\nNow I'm less fine.\n\nHave you heard your brother has gotten engaged? - No.\n\nSheldon,why didn't you tell me?\n\nMy bad. I did send a gift from both of us.\n\nShe's a remarkable girl.\n\nThe youngest appeals court judge in New Jersey and a two-time Olympic bronze medalist.\n\nYou must be very happy. - Why? I'm not marrying her.\n\nSo,how about you? Are you seeing anyone interesting?\n\nWell,I'm not sure about interesting,but...\n\nNot the time,Sheldon. - Very well.\n\nShall we switch topics toIsaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?\n\nIt's all right,Sheldon.\n\nI will just pretend that Leonard's not withholding information.\n\nAlthough, I will point out,Leonard, that I am a trained psychiatrist and you are exhibiting the same secretive behavioral tics that accompanied your learning to masturbate.\n\nIsn't she brilliant, Leonard?\n\nHow I envy you.\n\nSo,Howard, have you and Rajesh finally summoned the courage to express your latent homosexual feelings toward one another?\n\nWhat? No.\n\nWhy not?\n\nBecause we don't have latent homosexual feelings toward one another.\n\nI see.\n\nNo,really. I have a girlfriend now.\n\nAnd where is she this evening?\n\nShe had to go out of town. Her grandmother died.\n\nI see.\n\nHer grandmother died.\n\nHonest to God.\n\nLeonard,tell her I have a girlfriend.\n\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\nWhat do you mean you don't know what I'm talking about?\n\nTell her I have a girlfriend!\n\nAll right. He \"has\" a \"girlfriend.\"\n\nHer name is Bernadette.She's working as a waitress, but she's going to school to be a microbiologist.\n\nHoward,keep in mind that the more passionately you stick to this construct, the more you're hurting your partner.\n\nDo you really think your lips in my ear is helping?\n\nSorry I'm late.\n\nOh,glad you're here. Uh,sit down. I'll get you a plate.\n\nMom,you rember Penny.\n\nOh,yes,the waitress slash actress with the unresolved father issues.\n\nHas he finally come to terms with his little slugger growing breasts?\n\nWell,he sent me a football and a catcher's mitt for Christmas, so I'm going to say no.\n\nIf it helps,we're all good with your breasts.\n\nClassic overcompensation.\n\nOh,speaking of fathers,Leonard, that reminds me, I'm divorcing your father.\n\nWhat? - Yes. He was cheating on me.\n\nNo! - Yes,with some waitress from the university cafeteria.\n\nCan you believe it? A waitress?\n\nOh,no offense,dear.\n\nNo,it sounded like a compliment.\n\nWhen did this happen?\n\nMmm,well,let's see. Sheldon,when did I leave Leonard's father?\n\nSeptember 22.\n\nOh,yes,that's right. The weekend after Leonard's dog died.\n\nMitzy's dead?\n\nShe was old and blind,Leonard.\n\nWhat choice did we have?\n\nI don't believe this. Why am I the last to know?\n\nExcuse me,Leonard,I am the one who's getting a divorce, Mitzy is the one who is dead.\n\nWhy are you the one making a fuss?\n\nYou're right. I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry. I'mwayout of line!\n\nSo,Penny,what's new in your life?\n\nNothing. Not a damn thing.\n\nThank you for driving me back to my hotel.\n\nOh,it's not a problem.\n\nI was going to ask Leonard to do it, but he seemed a bit emotionally unstable and you don't want someone like that operating heavy machinery.\n\nNo,you do not.\n\nYour \"check engine\" light is on.\n\nYeah,I gotta put a sticker over that.\n\nSo,uh,you must be devastated about your divorce.\n\nOh,not at all.\n\nBut I am a bit distressed to be in a vehicle that's not subjected to regular maintenance.\n\nCome on,I mean, you're not upset that your marriage is over?\n\nWell,initially I felt something akin to grief and perhaps anger, but that's the natural reaction of the limbic system to being betrayed by a loathsome son of a bitch.\n\nSure,sure.\n\nThankfully,my shock was somewhat mitigated by the fact that\n\nI haven't had intercourse with him in eight years.\n\nEight years?\n\nOh,that's nothing.\n\nI've been responsible for my own orgasms since 1982.\n\nYikes.\n\nWhat's so funny?\n\nThat's exactly what I say during orgasms: \"Yikes.\"\n\nYou know what? I could use a drink. Do you want to stop for a drink?\n\nOh,I don't drink. - I do,I'll teach you.\n\nLeonard? Leonard? Leonard...\n\nWhat is it?\n\nI made tea.\n\nI don't want tea.\n\nI didn't make tea for you.\n\nThis is my tea.\n\nThen why are you telling me?\n\nIt's a conversation starter.\n\nThat's a lousy conversation starter.\n\nOh,is it? We're conversing. Checkmate.\n\nWhat do you want,Sheldon?\n\nWhat I want is to be departing the starshipEnterprise in a one-man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid I rule known as Sheldon Alpha Five.\n\nI want that too.\n\nWhy are you here?\n\nTo comfort you,of course.\n\nNo,that's not going to work at all.\n\nI'll comfort you from over here.\n\nLeonard,what you're experiencing is a classic Jungian crisis in which the aging individual mourns the loss of the never-to-be realized ideal family unit.\n\nThank you, that's very comforting.\n\nThat's not the comforting part.\n\nIt's not? - No,no.\n\nThe comforting part is that the Germans have a term for what you're feeling.\n\nWeltschmerz.\n\nIt means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical, idealized world.\n\nYou're right,I do feel better.\n\nWell,the Germans have always been a comforting people.\n\nJust rember,Leonard, where your biological family has failed you, you always have me,your surrogate family.\n\nYou're my surrogate family?\n\nIf it's any consolation, I'm not happy about it either. Good night.\n\nOkay,now this time try drinking it all at once.\n\nYikes.\n\nI've been responsible for my own buzz since 2003.\n\nAnother round for me and my homegirl.\n\nI feel a spreading warmth through my extremities.\n\nAs long as you don't feel it running down your pants, you're fine.\n\nOh,that is fascinating.\n\nI'm noticing an immediate lowering of my inhibitions.\n\nFor example, I'm seriously considering asking that busboy to ravish me in the alleyway while I eat cheesecake.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nWell,we are known for our cheesecake.\n\nHit us again. - Yes.\n\nIf a little is good, more must be better.\n\nHey,Bev,guess what? - What?\n\nI'm sleeping with your son.\n\nReally? Which one?\n\nThe one from whom I live across the hall... from.\n\nWell,that's convenient. How did his penis turn out?\n\nOh,Beverly,I can't talk to my boyfriend's mother about his penis.\n\nOh,fair enough. What can you tell me, if anything, about that busboy's penis? actually,I've only had the cheesecake.\n\nOne more time.\n\nYou know,Leonard did not want to tell you we were dating.\n\nReally?\n\nWell,that means he's either embarrassed about the relationship or he doesn't care enough about his mother to tell her he's in one.\n\nEither way,one of us should be insulted.\n\nWell,let's go find out who.\n\nYou go get a taxi. I'm gonna slip my business card into that busboy's back pocket, cupping his firm,right buttock as I do so.\n\nLeonard...? - Sonny boy!\n\nGet out here! Your mommy wants to talk to you!\n\nWhat the hell is going on?\n\nYou're in trouble.\n\nWhy didn't you tell me you were tapping my homegirl?\n\nDid I say that right? - Yeah,not bad,not bad.\n\nAre you guys drunk?\n\nWell,I hope so. Otherwise,why would we have stopped at Del Taco?\n\nNow,how could you not tell me you were in a relationship with this lovely, charming young woman?\n\nOh,thank you. - You're welcome.\n\nIs it because she's uneducated, trapped in a menial service position?\n\nWhat the hell happened to \"lovely and charming\"?\n\nHow come you didn't tell me that you and Father were getting a divorce?\n\nHow come you didn't tell me you had surgery?\n\nHow come you didn't tell me my dog died?\n\nWait,wait,wait,wait,wait...\n\nWhat I hear you saying is that you want a more intimate mother-son relationship.\n\nI do.\n\nThere. It's late. Now,go to bed.\n\nI'm getting a warm feeling spreading through my heart.\n\nThat's the Del Taco.\n\nWhy is Leonard softly banging his head against his bedroom door?\n\nSpeaking of warm feelings-- come here.\n\nNo,I'd rather have the busboy.\n\nThank you for taking me to the airport.\n\nYou're very welcome.\n\nOnce again, I'm driving. I'm right here.\n\nPlease,I am very hungover and in no mood to satisfy your need for approval.\n\nSheldon,I do hope you'll forgive me for my inappropriate behavior last night.\n\nI don't blame you. You were intoxicated.\n\nThank you.\n\nI blame Penny.\n\nI blame Penny,too. Bad Penny.\n\nWait a minute, what are you talking about?\n\nWhat inappropriate behavior?\n\nI think it's best that you not know.\n\nAgreed. - Agreed.\n\nWhat the hell-- agreed.\n\nAnd I want you to take very good care of this young woman.\n\nOh,thank you,Beverly. - You're welcome.\n\nShe doesn't have much in the way of career prospects.\n\nDon't make her responsible for her own orgasms as well.\n\nMother,remember when I was complaining that you don't communicate with me enough?\n\nYes,dear. - I'm over it.\n\nFa-la,la-la,la, la-la... la... la!\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "3e5659db-df38-4c03-94e2-be1bd220ce00": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e5659db-df38-4c03-94e2-be1bd220ce00", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "b70e9c491faa444655f7bbd733952e0a133201fe285021084f65d2a5f330a48f", "text": "\n\nLook at us.

Cholermus.\n\nIt's a traditional Swiss breakfast dish.\n\nI'm preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland.\n\nYou're not going to Switzerland!\n\nOh, but I am.\n\nDidn't Penny tell you the good news?\n\nShe told me that you went behind my back to guilt her into letting you go instead of her.\n\nYes, that good news.\n\nWell, forget it.\n\nI was the one who was invited.\n\nI get to decide who goes with me, and it's Penny, not you!\n\nHoward, could you lower the lights?\n\nI have a short PowerPoint presentation.\n\nI don't need to see your presentation.\n\nThis discussion is over!\n\nThat's a somewhat ambiguous response.\n\nAm I going or not?\n\nSheldon, at this point,\n\nI would go by myself before I would take you.\n\nReally?\n\nYeah, really. ****\n\nFrom this moment forward, we can be roommates, but we will no longer be friends.\n\nI'm sorry you feel that way.\n\nI don't think you're fully aware of the ramifications here, Leonard.\n\nWhy don't you enlighten me?\n\nWith the friendship clause of our roommate agreement nullified you are no longer entitled to accompany me to go swimming at Bill Gates' house should I be invited.\n\nOoh, that's gotta sting.\n\nJust think, this time tomorrow we'll be in Geneva, Switzerland for our first Valentine's Day.\n\nI know!\n\nI went shopping today and bought special undies for the occasion.\n\nThermal?

You sent more than one letter about that?\n\nIt bothers me.\n\nSheldon, this is a summons.\n\nA summons for what?\n\nLooks like you ran a red light on Marengo Avenue at 9:30 p.m. on November 16.\n\nThey got you on a traffic camera.\n\nNice picture.\n\nNovember 16?\n\nPenny, that's the evening you fell in your bathtub and I had to drive you to the emergency room.\n\nNo, it isn't.\n\nYes, it is.\n\nNo, it isn't.\n\nPenny, I have an eidetic memory.\n\nAlso, that's a picture of you in the passenger seat holding your dislocated shoulder.\n\nMmm, no, it isn't.\n\nOkay, then why is a summons for a traffic violation committed in your car, bearing your license plates, coming to me?\n\nOkay, look, they sent me the ticket.\n\nI told them\n\nI wasn't driving and they were all, \"If it wasn't you, who was it?\"\n\nSo you betrayed me?\n\nNo!\n\nIt wasn't a betrayal.\n\nIt was more of a \"I can't afford any more points on my license.\"\n\nI already have to buy my insurance from this place in the Cayman Islands.\n\nBut the only reason\n\nI was driving your car was because you were in distress and I was rescuing you.\n\nYes, yes, look, and now you have a photo to remember that heroic day.\n\nIt's not that big a deal.\n\nYou just go down to the court on Thursday and you pay the fine.\n\nI'm not going to pay a fine.\n\nThat would imply\n\nI'm guilty.\n\nYou are guilty.\n\nThat one I liked.\n\nI am not guilty.\n\nI only have a learner's permit.\n\nPenny was the teacher.\n\nWhen the light turned yellow she said \"Go, go, go.\"\n\nSo I went, went, went.\n\nSheldon, I'm sorry.\n\nI'll be happy to reimburse you for the fine.\n\nYou know, as soon as I get a part in a movie or my own TV series.\n\nYou don't need to reimburse me because I'm not paying.\n\nOn Thursday, I will have my day in court and justice will be done.\n\nIn fact, I'm going to begin preparing my defense right now.\n\nOkay, he's going to jail.\n\nOh, that's right.\n\nThursday is Stan Lee Day.\n\nNow you see what you've done?\n\nBecause of you, we're all going to miss Stan Lee.\n\nWhoa!\n\nWhat do you mean \"all?\"\n\nWell, you're my friends.\n\nYou'll be standing by my side, supporting me, feeding me legal precedents, and if you had the upper body strength, carrying me out on your shoulders when I'm victorious.\n\nYeah, okay. No.\n\nAre you saying that you will not stand beside me as I plead my case?\n\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\nHoward?\n\nWow.\n\nUh, Stan Lee, or you in court.\n\nUh, if this was <i>Sophie's Choice</i> it would've been a much shorter movie. No.\n\nRaj?\n\nYou'll be there, won't you?\n\nAll right, then.\n\nMy so-called friends have forsaken me.\n\nSo, I guess it'll just be me and my eyewitness.\n\nOh, balls.\n\nPlease try to wear something appropriate.\n\nIt won't help my case if the judge is busy trying to read the word \"Juicy\" scrawled across your buttocks.\n\nPenny.\n\nPenny.\n\nPenny.\n\nThat's just wrong.\n\nAll right, let's go.\n\nWait, hold on.\n\nBefore we get to the courthouse,\n\nI'd like to call on your skills as an actress.\n\nWhat is this?\n\nI've taken the liberty of scripting your appearance on the witness stand because, let's face it, you're somewhat of a loose cannon.\n\nNow, don't worry; it's written in your vernacular.\n\nSo shall we rehearse?\n\nDo I have a choice?\n\nWell, of course you have a choice.\n\nAlthough we live in a deterministic universe, each individual has free will.\n\nNow, sit down.\n\nI call your attention to the events of November 16.\n\nDo you remember that date? \"Darn tootin', I do. \"If the court will excuse my homespun, corn-fed Nebraskan turn of phrase.\"\n\nThat's excellent. Go on. \"The reason that date is, like, \"so totally fixed in my memory \"is that I had the privilege to be witness to one of the most heroic acts\n\nI've ever seen in, like, ever.\" \"And who performed that heroic act?\" \"Why, you did, sir. \"You. Dr. Sheldon Cooper.\n\nAnd may I add, it is a privilege to know you.\" \"There's no need for compliments.\n\nThis court is only interested in the facts.\" \"But it is a fact that it's a privilege to know you.\n\nTotally.\"\n\nA teardrop rolls down my cheek?!\n\nOnly a suggestion.\n\nA catch in your throat would work just as well. \"But it is a fact \"that it's a privilege to know you.\n\nTotally.\"\n\nMaybe you should put on your \"Juicy\" pants again.\n\nPay the cashier.\n\nSheldon Cooper.\n\nGood morning, Your Honor.\n\nDr. Sheldon Cooper appearing in pro se.\n\nThat is to say, representing himself.\n\nI know what it means.\n\nI went to law school.\n\nAnd yet you wound up in traffic court.\n\nAnyway, if it would please the court,\n\nI'd like to begin with an opening statement.\n\nThe court would advise you to make it quick, as the court had a dicey-looking breakfast burrito this morning and just took an Imodium.\n\nVery well.\n\nA quick opening statement.\n\nLike a milking stool, my case rests on three legs.\n\nI will demonstrate that I was improperly instructed in driving by a woman whose lack of respect for society borders on the sociopathic.\n\nI will argue that the emergency met the legal doctrine of <i>quod est necessarium</i> that which is necessary is legal.\n\nBut first,\n\nI will raise a Sixth Amendment issue.\n\nI'm unable to confront my accuser, a non-human entity, to wit, a camera.\n\nSo, to sum up: improper instruction;\n\nSixth Amendment.\n\nMy milk stool is complete.\n\nImpressive.\n\nThank you.\n\nGuilty.\n\nPay the cashier.\n\nI object.\n\nYou're completely ignoring the law.\n\nNo, I'm <i>following</i> the law.\n\nI'm ignoring <i>you.</i>\n\nReally?\n\nI would point out that I am at the top of my profession, while you preside over the kiddy table of yours.\n\nDr. Cooper, before I find you in contempt and throw you in jail,\n\nI'm going to give you a chance to apologize for that last remark.\n\nI am a scientist.\n\nI never apologize for the truth.\n\nThat's my spot.\n\nI can't wait to ask Stan Lee why he insists on giving all his characters first and last names that start with the same letter.\n\nOh, come on.\n\nWhy would you do that?\n\nBruce Banner, Reed Richards,\n\nSue Storm, Stephen Strange,\n\nOtto Octavius,\n\nSilver Surfer,\n\nPeter Parker, oh, and worst of all,\n\nJ. Jonah Jameson, Jr.\n\nOkay, I'm cutting.\n\nI'm not gonna talk to Stan Lee after you cheese him off.\n\nHey.\n\nSheldon's in jail.\n\nSheldon's in jail?!\n\nYou called it.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nFor what?\n\nFor doing the same crap he always does, except to a judge.\n\nHe has to stay in there until he apologizes.\n\nSo tell him to apologize.\n\nOh, gee, thanks, Leonard.\n\nThat didn't occur to me.\n\nIf he doesn't apologize by 5:00, he is going to spend the night in jail.\n\nOh, no, that's terrible.\n\nOoh, the line's moving.\n\nGot to go. Bye.\n\nExcuse me?\n\nExcuse me, jailor?\n\nWhat?\n\nI need to use the restroom.\n\nKnock yourself out.\n\nThat's the toilet?\n\nWell, it ain't a wishing well.\n\nPlease tell the judge\n\nI'm ready to apologize.\n\nLook at that. \"To my friend, Leonard.\n\nFrom Stan Lee, Excelsior!\"\n\nAwesome.\n\nMine says, \"To my friend, Howard.\n\nFrom Stan Lee, Excelsior!\"\n\nMine says, \"To Raj, from Stan Lee.\"\n\nThat's 'cause you pissed him off about his character names.\n\nHey,\n\nI didn't even mention\n\nDum Dum Dugan or Green Goblin,\n\nMatt Murdock,\n\nPepper Potts,\n\nVictor Von Doom, oh, and worst of all,\n\nMillie the Model.\n\nWe're home.\n\nOh, hey, buddy. How'd it go?\n\nYou know very well how it went.\n\nYeah, but we all want to hear it from you.\n\nI was found guilty and fined $533.\n\nI'm going to write you a check for that.\n\nAs long as you promise to put it in your drawer and never cash it, like the others.\n\nI also now have three points on a driver's license\n\nI do not yet possess, and I was forced to issue an undeserved apology, simply because\n\nI refuse to urinate in a stainless steel bowl in front of criminals.\n\nPlus, you didn't get to meet Stan Lee.\n\nOkay, that's enough, Howard.\n\nThe poor guy's had a tough time.\n\nHe had to spend the entire afternoon in jail wearing that suit.\n\nYou're right, so it would be cruel to mention that after he finished signing autographs,\n\nStanley took Stuart and us out for gelato.\n\nYou had gelato with Stan Lee?\n\nHe said we could call him Stan.\n\nExcept for Raj.\n\nWell, I hope you're satisfied, Penny.\n\nYou are responsible for all the evil that has befallen me today.\n\nOkay, I realize that...\n\nNot finished.\n\nIt is because of you that I now have a criminal record, and it is because of you that I missed out on having gelato with Stan Lee.\n\nOkay, maybe you'll have another chance to have...\n\nNo, no.\n\nI will never have another chance to have gelato with Stan Lee because opportunities to have gelato with Stan Lee come but once in a lifetime. \"The moving finger writes, and having writ, moves on!\"\n\nDid he just somehow give me the finger?\n\nNot just the finger.\n\nThe moving finger.\n\nHey, Stuart.\n\nOh, hey, Penny.\n\nWow. Hi.\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nNothing.\n\nI'm just getting ready to close up and... head out.\n\nAh.\n\nCool. Got any fun plans?\n\nOh, yeah. Big night tonight.\n\nGonna share a can of tuna with the cat.\n\nOh, nice.\n\nNot even my cat.\n\nI just feed it.\n\nSome nights it doesn't even show up.\n\nOh, okay.\n\nWell, I was hoping, um, you could do me a favor.\n\nSure, yeah, name it.\n\nWell, I'm kind of responsible for Sheldon missing Stan Lee, and I really want to make it up to him.\n\nSo I was hoping you could give me his phone number so maybe I can arrange for them to meet.\n\nOh, I'm sorry, I don't\n\nHmm. Damn.\n\nMm.\n\nAll right. Thank you.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nWait.\n\nI have his address.\n\nReally?\n\nGreat!\n\nBut I can't give it to you.\n\nThen why did you tell me you had it?\n\nI don't know.\n\nJust chatting.\n\nYou're looking at a guy who could very well get stood up by a stray cat tonight.\n\nI'm sorry, Stuart.\n\nThanks anyway.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nWait.\n\nYeah?\n\nMaybe we can make a deal.\n\nWhat kind of deal?\n\nI will give you the address if you go to my cousin's wedding with me.\n\nYou're extorting a date out of me?\n\nI kind of have to.\n\nThe cousin who's getting married is the cousin I usually go to weddings with.\n\nCan I bring Leonard?\n\nSure. What the hell.\n\nDeal.\n\nWe'll tell people he's your cousin.\n\nThis is Stan Lee's front door.\n\nWe were on Stan\n\nLee's curb, then we were on\n\nStan Lee's walk, and now we're at Stan Lee's front door.\n\nYup.\n\nOh, Lord, you just rang\n\nStan Lee's doorbell.\n\nAt Stan Lee's house.\n\nWe're about to go in and have milk and cookies with Stan Lee.\n\nOkay, sweetie, I don't know if we're gonna have cookies, or he's just gonna say hi, or really what's gonna happen, so just let me talk, and we'll... ?\n\nYeah?\n\nAre you Stan Lee?\n\nOh, damn.\n\nHi. I'm Penny.\n\nThis is my friend, Sheldon.\n\nWe're not friends at the moment.\n\nDepends on how this goes.\n\nRight, right. Anyway,\n\nSheldon here is a huge fan of yours, and he was supposed to meet you the other day at the comic book store, but he kind of ended up in jail.\n\nI see. And you thought you'd just come over to my house uninvited?\n\nYou said we\n\nOh, no, no, I said\n\nI'm inviting you to come with me to Stan Lee's house.\n\nYou know, you fan boys are unbelievable.\n\nDo you think you can just ring my doorbell any time you want?\n\nI mean, why don't you just come on in and watch the Lakers game with me?\n\nWell, I'm not much of a sports fan, but thank you.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nHe doesn't really understand sarcasm.\n\nWell, I'll give him something he'll understand.\n\nJoanie, call the police!\n\nNice to meet you.\n\nFantastic Four,\n\nDaredevil,\n\nInvincible Iron Man,\n\nHappy Hogan,\n\nCurt Connors...\n\nWould you just let it go?\n\nAnd worst of all,\n\nFin Fang Foom.\n\nHey, where've you been?\n\nI'll tell you where I've been.\n\nYou boys may have had gelato with Stan Lee and gotten autographed comics, but I saw the inside of his house and got an autographed application for a restraining order.\n\nSweet.\n\nPlus, I get to hang out with him again at the hearing.\n\nThis is going to look great hanging next to my restraining order from Leonard Nimoy.

Oh, please, we all know I'm the friend you call when you have no other options.\n\nIf we were the Justice League,\n\nI'd be Aquaman.\n\nI <i>wish</i> you were Aquaman.\n\nThen I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank.\n\nExcuse me, I'm thirsty, so I'm going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage.\n\nYou know what? I'll just spend the evening alone.\n\nWhat, suddenly I'm not good enough for you?\n\nAh...\n\nI do so love beverages.\n\nNow I think I'll take my after-dinner walk.\n\nSince when do you take after-dinner walks?\n\nYeah, since when do you take walks?\n\nI read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion, but increases serotonin, and you know me, if there's one thing I like more than a refreshing beverage, it's serotonin.

I'm also pleased to report that he's all cried out over you.\n\nHe's been crying?\n\nOh, I believe that was something else\n\nI wasn't supposed to mention.\n\nOh, God, I feel terrible.\n\nDo you have a stomachache, too?\n\nNo. Why, do you?\n\nNo.\n\nWhy did you ask if I had one, too?\n\nJust making polite dinner conversation.\n\nYour turn.\n\nAll right.\n\nSo, what's new in your life?\n\nWell, my new shoes are not made for running.\n\nHave you been running?\n\nNo.\n\nIt's just a suspicion I have.\n\nMmm, mmm, mmm.\n\nI'm so glad you like it.

Well, so the emotional turmoil that's been keeping me from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified?\n\nYes.\n\nWell... then as my meemaw would say, \"Looks like we butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon.\"\n\nI guess not.\n\nAnd now, as promised, the tangent.\n\nSheldon and the Hell Hound.\n\nOr <i>How I Lost My Hot Dogs.</i>\n\nOh, um...\n\nI, I can come back.\n\nD-don't be silly.\n\nWe're neighbors.\n\nWe're going to run into each other.\n\nMay as well get used to it.\n\nYeah, I guess you're right.\n\nYou used to it yet?\n\nNope.

He's fine with Pluto.\n\nHey, do you think the elastic woman in <i>The Incredibles</i> needs to use birth control or can she just be a diaphra?\n\nWell, that's it.\n\nWe're officially out of things to talk about.\n\nWe're home.\n\nIt's 10:00.\n\nWhere have you been? We stayed for the California\n\nAdventure water show.\n\nIt was pure Disney magic.\n\nI was going to see that with him.\n\nHow was I supposed to know that?\n\nIt's all right.\n\nI'll see it again with you.\n\nAnd I have food here.\n\nYou said you were ing to call.\n\nI know, I know.\n\nI can still eat.\n\nNo, you already threw up once.\n\nGo put on your PJs and brush your teeth.\n\nOkay, but just don't fight\n\nWee not fighting. Just go.\n\nAren't you going to thank Penny for taki you to Disneyland?\n\nThank you, Penny.\n\nYou're welcome, sweetie.\n\nWant a cup of coffee?\n\nOh, um, I should probably get going.\n\nCome on. It's just a cup of coffee.\n\nUh, yeah, the whole thing seems a little twisted to me, too.\n\nWhat am I smelling?\n\nSheldon's churro on my shoes.\n\nHe's such an angel when he's asleep.\n\nYeah.\n\nShame he has to wake up.\n\nI think we can do it.\n\nSmother Sheldon in his sleep?\n\nWouldn't that be wrong?\n\nNo, be friends.

I'm moving the dirty sock.\n\nThank you.\n\nRaj, keep an eye out for the other one.\n\nHey, guys, this is my friend Zack.\n\nHey.\n\nHello.\n\nWhoa!\n\nIs that the laser?\n\nIt's bitchin'.\n\nYes.\n\nIn 1917, when Albert Einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper was that the resultant device be bitchin'.\n\nWell, mission accomplished.\n\nLet me explain what we're doing here.\n\nUm, in 1969, the astronauts on <i>Apollo 11</i> positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon, and we're going to shoot a laser off one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier.\n\nOh! That's very cool.\n\nOne question.\n\nHow can you be sure it won't blow up?\n\nThe laser?\n\nThe moon.\n\nSee, now this is a man for Penny.\n\nThat's a great question, Zack.\n\nNo, it's not.\n\nSheldon!\n\nPlay nice.\n\nIt's not a great question.\n\nHow could somebody possibly think we're going to blow up the moon?\n\nDon't worry about the moon.\n\nWe-We set our laser to stun.\n\nSmart.\n\nNow, we'll be able to see the beam when it leaves, but it won't be strong enough when it comes back to be seen by the naked eye.\n\nNaked.\n\nRight. Uh... funny.\n\nUh, that device, there, will measure the photons that return and let us see it on this computer.\n\nRaj, get them some glasses.\n\nCool, it's gonna be in 3-D?\n\nPreparing to fire laser at the moon.\n\nMake it so.\n\nThere it is.\n\nThere's the spike! light to return.\n\nThat's the moon!\n\nWe hit the moon!\n\nThat's your big experiment?\n\nAll that for a line on the screen?\n\nYeah, but, uh, think about what this represents.\n\nThe fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that there are man-made objects on the moon, put there by a member of a species that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane.\n\nWhat species is that?\n\nI was wrong.\n\nPenny can do better.\n\nOkay, guys, thank you, it's been fun.\n\nYeah, thanks.\n\nShould we invite them to the party?\n\nNo, just keep walking.\n\nHe must be very skilled at coitus.\n\nI'm telling you, dude, the only way to feel better about Penny going out with other guys is for you to get back on the whores.\n\nHorse.\n\nWhat?\n\nThe phrase is \"get back on the horse,\" not \"whores.\"\n\nThat's disgusting, dude.\n\nNo, it's not...\n\nNever mind.\n\nHe is right, though.\n\nIf you want, I can turn you on to this great new dating site I found.\n\nNo, thanks.\n\nYou sure?

I just thought as an outsider, you might be able to provide a fresh perspective.\n\nI have <i>no</i> difficulty believing you're not butter.\n\nOh, hey.\n\nOh, hi.\n\nUm, I gotta run.\n\nEarly shift.\n\nOkay, I'll walk down with you.\n\nSo, last night was fun, huh?\n\nYeah, it must have been.\n\nI just threw up in my closet.\n\nBummer.\n\nAnyway, I was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie.\n\nOh, yeah, tonight's not great for me.\n\nDoesn't have to be tonight.\n\nI'm free pretty much always.\n\nLeonard, last night was a mistake.\n\nWhen you say \"mistake,\" do you mean a fortunate mistake, like the discovery of penicillin?\n\nLook, I'm sorry.\n\nI was drunk, I was lonely,\n\nI hated Zack.\n\nCan we just forget it ever happened?\n\nNo, it's pretty well imprinted on my brain.\n\nEspecially the whole rodeo thing.\n\nOh, God!\n\nSo, that's it?\n\nWham, bam, thank you, Leonard?\n\nLook, I said I'm sorry.\n\nCan't you please let it go?\n\nHow am I supposed to let it go?\n\nYou used me for sex!\n\nMorning, Mrs. Gunderson.\n\nGood morning, Leonard.\n\nOr should I say \"yee-haw\"?\n\nHoly crap.\n\nWhat?\n\nWe finally have proof that aliens walk among us.\n\nExcuse me?\n\nThe dating site matched a woman with Sheldon.\n\nYou're kidding.\n\nAn actual woman?\n\nYeah, look.\n\nBreasts and everything.\n\nTrust me, breasts doesn' necessarily mean woman.\n\nSince when?\n\nI'll show you a picture of my Uncle Louie in a bathing suit sometime.\n\nLeonard, you gotta see this.\n\nWe found a match for Sheldon.\n\nGreat.\n\nMaybe she can have sex with him, and then walk out on him the next morning without so much as a \"How do you do?\"\n\nDo you know what he's talking about?\n\nNope.\n\nWhy don't you ask him?\n\nLeonard, what are you talking about?\n\nI don't want to talk about it.\n\nThat was a lousy suggestion.\n\nWhatever.\n\nRight now,\n\nDr. Sheldon Cooper has to send an e-mail to his perfect match. \"Greetings, fellow life-form...\"\n\nIf she can do it, I can do it.\n\nIf she can do it, I can do it.\n\nIf she can do it, I can do it.\n\nI can't do it.\n\nHello?\n\nOh, hi. Hey.\n\nHi, Leslie.\n\nLeonard Hofstadter.\n\nWhat're you doing here?\n\nUh, I know!\n\nIt's been a while!\n\nYeah, 18 months.\n\nRight. Right.\n\nSo how you doing?\n\nFine. You?\n\nUh, not bad.\n\nYou remember when we used to have sex and you said that it didn't mean anything, it was just for fun?\n\nYeah.\n\nYou, uh, want to do that again?\n\nWhat happened?\n\nBlondie dumped you?\n\nShe didn't dump me.\n\nWe were just in different places in the relationship.\n\nRight.\n\nUm... anyway, apparently, it's okay to go back to people you're no longer seeing and have recreational sex with them.\n\nUh-huh.\n\nSo, what do you say?\n\nLet me think about it.\n\nShe's not coming back.\n\nUh-oh.\n\nShe wants to meet us.\n\nNot us. Him.\n\nYes, but him doesn't even know about her.\n\nWell, him about to find out about her.\n\nReally? Us gonna tell him?\n\nWho's going to tell whom about what?\n\nSheldon.\n\nHey. Hi.\n\nYour surprise confuses me.\n\nI live here.\n\nRight.\n\nSo, listen, what are you doing tomorrow afternoon?\n\nBe more specific.\n\nThat's not afternoon.\n\nThat's preevning.\n\nWhat?\n\nIt's a time of day I invented.\n\nIt better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening: preevning.\n\nI'm fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need.\n\nRight, okay.\n\nWhat are you doing tomorrow preevning?\n\nWell, tomorrow's Saturday.\n\nSaturday night is laundry night.\n\nSo I'll be spending the preevning pre-sorting and pre-soaking.\n\nOkay, what if I were to tell you, tomorrow, at 4:30, you could meet a woman who has been scientifically chosen to be your perfect mate?\n\nI would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air, exhausted by your constant tomfoolery.\n\nBut it's true.\n\nBut we-we put all your vital information into this dating site, answered all their questions just like you would, and they found a match for you.\n\nHer name is\n\nAmy Farrah Fowler.\n\nPlease.\n\nEven assuming you could answer any question the way I would, the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum.\n\nAnd that's exactly the answer we gave to the question: \"What is your attitude towards online dating?\"\n\nHoward wanted to write \"mumbo jumbo,\" but I said no.\n\nOur Sheldon would say \"hokum.\"\n\nCome on, where's your scientific curiosity?\n\nWell, most of it is being applied to unraveling the secrets of the universe while the rest of it's wondering why\n\nI'm having this conversation with you.\n\nOkay, how about this.\n\nEven Spock had a date once every seven years.\n\nHe didn't date.\n\nIt was <i>pon farr.</i>\n\nHis blood boiled with mating lust.\n\nWell, why-why don't you start with a cup of coffee, and you can <i>pon farr</i>\n\nAmy Farrah Fowler later.\n\nI don't drink coffee.\n\nAll right, you can have a hot chocolate.\n\nAs I will not be engaging in this nonsense, my choice of beverage is moot.\n\nBut for the record,\n\nI only drink hot chocolate in months with an \"R\" in them.\n\nWhy?\n\nWhat's life without whimsy?\n\nOkay, I'm out.\n\nSheldon, I've hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment.\n\nUnless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl, it will remain there forever.\n\nYou're bluffing.\n\nAre you willing to risk it?\n\nCurse you.\n\nOh. Hey, Leonard.\n\nI was a perfectly happy, geeky, little lonely guy, and you ruined me!\n\nAre you drunk?\n\nCome on. We're gonna have sex, and it's not gonna mean a thing!\n\nAre you out of your mind?!\n\nI'm really starting to think there's a double standard here.\n\nIn a few minutes, when I gloat over the failure of this enterprise, how would you prefer I do it?\n\nThe standard \"I told you so\"?\n\nThe classic \"neener-neener\"?\n\nOr just my normal look of haughty derision?\n\nYou don't know we're wrong yet.\n\nHaughty derision it is.\n\nExcuse me.\n\nI'm Amy Farrah Fowler.\n\nYou're Sheldon Cooper.\n\nHello, Amy Farrah Fowler.\n\nI'm sorry to inform you that you have been taken in by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely.\n\nAdditionally,\n\nI'm being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock.\n\nIf that was slang,\n\nI'm unfamiliar with it.\n\nIf it was literal, I share your aversion to soiled hosiery.\n\nIn any case,\n\nI'm here because my mother and I have agreed that I will date at least once a year.\n\nInteresting.\n\nMy mother and I have the same agreement about church.\n\nI don't object to the concept of a deity, but I'm baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance.\n\nWell, then you might want to avoid East Texas.\n\nNoted.\n\nNow, before this goes any further, you should know that all forms of physical contact up to and including coitus are off the table.\n\nMay I buy you a beverage?\n\nTepid water, please.\n\nGood God, what have we done?

Well, then, there's a couple of things you should probably know.\n\nI have a master's degree and two doctorates.\n\nThe things I should know,\n\nI do know.\n\nMy point is, I know more about dating than you, and if you were as smart as you think you are, you would listen to me.\n\nIf you know so much, how come I have a date tonight and you have nothing better to do than drive me to it?\n\nFair point.\n\nYou know, there's something\n\nI've always wondered about Aquaman.\n\nYeah?\n\nWhere does he poop?\n\nWhat?\n\nWhat would a toilet look like in Atlantis?\n\nHow would you flush it?\n\nAnd when you did flush it, where would the poop go?\n\nHold that thought.\n\nHey, Howard.\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nWhat...\n\nHold on.\n\nHoward, Howard, slow down.\n\nThe robot hand is stuck on your what?\n\nYou're not going to believe this.\n\nSo, um, Amy,\n\nSheldon tells me you're a neuro... something-or-other.\n\nNeurobiologist.\n\nYour \"check engine\" light is on.\n\nYeah, it's okay.\n\nBut the light indicates...\n\nDon't bother.\n\nI've wasted many an hour tilting at that particular windmill.\n\nUh, what is that scent you're wearing?\n\nIt smells great.\n\nDandruff shampoo.\n\nI have dry scalp.\n\nAh.\n\nWell, your hair looks very nice.\n\nAre you a homosexual?\n\nNo, no, I'm just giving you a compliment.\n\nHmm.\n\nWould have been more flattered if you were a homosexual.\n\nGuys, how 'bout some music?\n\nOh, no, I wouldn't care for that.\n\nAmy?\n\nNo, thank you.\n\nOkay.\n\nUncomfortable silence it is.\n\nHey, Sheldon, have you told Amy what it was like for you growing up in Texas?\n\nNo.\n\nWell, why don't you tell her?\n\nAll right.\n\nIt was hell.\n\nAny follow up, Amy?\n\nNo.\n\nI myself grew up in Nebraska.\n\nSmall town outside of Omaha.\n\nNice place, mostly family farms, a few meth labs.\n\nI'm sorry, how is this better than uncomfortable silence?\n\nI don't know.\n\nI was just trying something.\n\nMuggles.\n\nYou slipped and fell into a robot hand?\n\nYes.\n\nPenis first?\n\nYes. Now, help me!\n\nI'd suggest a lubricant, but I have a feeling you fell on some of that as well.\n\nNot funny, Leonard.\n\nReally? A robot hand's got a death grip on your junk, dude.\n\nThat's funny, ask anyone.\n\nPlea-- before my mother walks in, get this off me!\n\nOkay, let's see.\n\nNo, no!\n\nDon't touch.\n\nThe program is paused.\n\nWell, then let's un-pause it.\n\nNo, no! I loaded the wrong program.\n\nThe hand thinks it's holding a screwdriver in outer space.\n\nIf you continue the program, it's gonna start twisting.\n\nA-All right.\n\nUm, how about this.\n\nWhen-when Winnie the Pooh got his head stuck in the honey tree, his friends all grabbed onto him and pulled and pulled.\n\nYou do what you want,\n\nI'm not touching another man's honey tree.\n\nAll right, uh, forget pulling.\n\nHow about we get an electric saw and cut it off?\n\nWhat?! No saws!\n\nOne circumcision was enough.\n\nHow about an acetylene torch?\n\nOkay, I can't believe this needs to be said out loud.\n\nNo pulling, no saws, no torches.\n\nWell, then what do you want us to do?\n\nMRS. WOLOWITZ (yelling):\n\nHoward, I made cookies for you and your little friends!\n\nThat's great, Mom, thanks!\n\nI'll bring them up with some Hawaiian Punch!\n\nDon't come up here!\n\nWhy not?! Are you ashamed of your mother?!\n\nYes, but that's not the point!\n\nGet me out of here.\n\nYou have any ideas, Raj?\n\nRight now, all I can think about is cookies and Hawaiian Punch.\n\nHey, here's another possible topic of conversation.\n\nThis is a big night for Sheldon.\n\nRight, Sheldon?\n\nBig night?\n\nThe winter solstice is a big night.\n\nIt's over 14 hours in Southern California.\n\nThat's an amusing factoid.\n\nThank you.\n\nNo, no.\n\nMy point is, uh, tonight is\n\nSheldon's first official date.\n\nDiscuss.\n\nIs this true?\n\nApparently, a semi-incestuous\n\nTeens for Jesus\n\nFourth of July Hoedown didn't count.\n\nSo, um, Amy, what about you?\n\nDo you date much?\n\nOnce a year.\n\nIt's a deal I made with my mother in exchange for her silence on the matter, as well as the occasional use of her George Foreman Grill that seals in the flavor without the fat.\n\nHow about you, Penny?\n\nDo you go on many dates?\n\nUh, yeah, I wouldn't say many.\n\nA few.\n\nWhat's...\n\nYour characterization of approximately 171 different men as \"a few.\"\n\nWhat...\n\nWhere did you get 171 men?\n\nSimple extrapolation.\n\nIn the three years that I've known you, you were single for two.\n\nDuring that time,\n\nI saw 17 different suitors.\n\nIf we work backwards, correcting for observation bias and postulate an initial dating age of 15...\n\nWhoa, wait, wait, wait.\n\nI did not start dating at 15.\n\nI'm sorry. Sixteen?\n\nFourteen.\n\nMy mistake.\n\nNow, assuming the left side of a bell curve peaking around the present, that would bring the total up to 193 men.\n\nPlus or minus eight men.\n\nRemarkable.\n\nDid you have sexual intercourse with all of these men?\n\nNo.\n\nAlthough that number would be fairly easy to calculate.\n\nOh.\n\nBased on the number of awkward encounters I've had with strange men leaving her apartment in the morning, plus the number of times she's returned home wearing the same clothes she wore the night before...\n\nOkay, Sheldon, I think you've made your point.\n\nSo we multiply 193-- minus 21 men before the loss of virginity-- so 172 times 0.18 gives us...\n\nLet's round that up to 31.\n\nOkay, Sheldon, you are so wrong.\n\nThat is not even close to the real number.\n\nI'm gonna need a drink over here.\n\nThis is very interesting.\n\nCultural perceptions are subjective.\n\nPenny, to your mind, are you a slut?\n\nNo! No!\n\nNo.\n\nLet's just all finish our dinners, okay?\n\nThis is an interesting topic.\n\nHow many sexual encounters have you had?\n\nDoes volunteering for a scientific experiment in which orgasm was achieved by electronically stimulating the pleasure centers of the brain count?\n\nI should think so.\n\nThen 128.\n\nOkay, come on.\n\nAlmost there.\n\nDon't tug.\n\nNo tugging.\n\nNext time, take your own advice.\n\nExcuse me, could you help us out?\n\nMy, my, my.\n\nWhat do we have here?\n\nI slipped and fell.\n\nYeah, we get that a lot.\n\nWhat is this?\n\nIt's a robot arm.\n\nWhere's the rest of the robot?\n\nI only built the arm. 'Cause that's all you needed, right?\n\nCan you please just help me?!\n\nAll right, all right.\n\nHang on, stay calm. with a wheelchair.\n\nI got a robot hand grasping a man's penis out here.\n\nYou think you could be a little more discreet?\n\nI'm sorry, we don't have a code for \"robot hand grasping a man's penis.\"\n\nWhy is it hooked up to a computer?\n\nUh, it's what controls the arm.\n\nBut it's frozen.\n\nDid you try turning it off and back on again?\n\nNo, you see, it's more complicated than that.\n\nNo, wait!\n\nWinnie the Pooh is out of the honey tree.\n\nNow can we have cookies and Hawaiian Punch?\n\nYou were right.\n\nThis was a very productive evening.\n\nI saw a whole new side of\n\nAmy Farrah Fowler tonight.\n\nI did not have sex with 31 guys.\n\nI'll be happy to check the math, but numbers don't lie, Penny.\n\nIn any event, now that Amy and I have spent quality time together,\n\nI feel much more confident proceeding to the next stage of our relationship.\n\nAnd that is?\n\nUsing in vitro fertilization and a surrogate uterus to gift humanity with our progeny.\n\nYou're still on that?\n\nIn these uncertain times, doesn't humanity deserve a gift?\n\nOkay, you know what?\n\nI'm gonna come at this in a whole new way.\n\nSheldon, if you try to make a baby with Amy in a petri dish,\n\nI'm gonna tell your mother on you.\n\nThat's no threat.\n\nMy mother's always wanted a grandchild.\n\nReally? Your deeply religious born-again Christian mother wants a test-tube grandbaby born out of wedlock?\n\nCurses.\n\nIf I'd thought of that in the first place,\n\nI could've saved myself this whole night.\n\nWell, it's not that late.\n\nYou could still go out and look for number 32.\n\nGood night.\n\nHey, Howard, what's up?\n\nI've decided not to procreate.\n\nYeah, yeah, great.\n\nHoward, uh, slow down.\n\nWhat do you mean it happened again?

I don't want to be here.\n\nSo, this is nice.\n\nFirst time we've all gotten together to eat.\n\nYou're right, he's a festival of humdrum chitchat.\n\nOkay, that's all I got.\n\nHoward, you're up.\n\nUm... tell us about your work, Amy.\n\nI doubt you'd understand.\n\nSheldon tells me you only have a master's degree.\n\nRaj, do you have any questions for Amy?\n\nI'm curious as to why we're not eating alone.\n\nThey can't function without me.\n\nI'm the social glue that holds this little group together.\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nListen, can I talk to you about your girlfriend?\n\nShe's not my girlfriend.\n\nShe's a girl and she's my friend, but there's no touching or unsanitary exchange of saliva.\n\nGot it.\n\nAlthough, for the record, on one occasion, she licked her thumb to remove raspberry jelly from the corner of my mouth.\n\nIt's an action we both regret to this day.\n\nUh-huh.\n\nAnyway, I'm not sure she's the best fit for our little-- how should we call it-- rebel alliance.\n\nOh, I never identified with the rebel alliance.\n\nDespite their tendency to build Death Stars,\n\nI've always been more of an empire man.\n\nYeah, not my point.\n\nI know what your point is.\n\nYou're intimidated by Amy's intellect.\n\nTo that I say, buck up.\n\nOkay, let me just get right to it.\n\nAmy is judgmental, sanctimonious and frankly... just obnoxious.\n\nSo?\n\nSo we already have you for all that.\n\nAre you suggesting I terminate my relationship with Amy?\n\nNo, no, of course not.\n\nJust have your relationship someplace else.\n\nMay I point out that for eight long months,\n\nI suffered in silence as your female companion filled our apartment with her off-key country music caterwauling, the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone against her calloused feet in our living room, and night after night of uninformative TV documentaries about the Jersey Shore.\n\nSuffered in silence?\n\nYes.\n\nAnd I'd thank you to do the same.\n\nReall-- Silence?!\n\nAh.\n\nNothing makes beer taste better than cool clear Rocky\n\nMountain spring water.\n\nWhere are the Rocky\n\nMountains, anyway?\n\nPhiladelphia.\n\nReally?\n\nI thought they were out West someplace.\n\nThink about it, Raj.\n\nWhere did the movie\n\nPhiladelphia.\n\nOkay, now I get it.\n\nSo this is the plan?\n\nFrom now on, we're just gonna hide out in here to avoid the Shamy?\n\nI'm very comfortable here.\n\nPenny, dear, why don't you shoot another silver bullet my way?\n\nGet one yourself.\n\nOoh, somebody's been taking bitchy pills.\n\nGod, he's an ass when he drinks.\n\nOh, he's an ass when he doesn't.\n\nYou just don't hear it.\n\nThink we need to start entertaining the possibility that the Shamy could go on for years.\n\nWell, if that's the case,\n\nPenny will have to get satellite TV and maybe once a week run a vacuum through this place.\n\nI thought you were going to talk to Sheldon.\n\nI did. Well, what'd he say?\n\nWell, he pointed out that he kinda sorta had to... put up with you.\n\nKinda sorta had to?\n\nI didn't agree with him.\n\nWell, you defended me, right?\n\nI tried, but... ...he made a fairly well-reasoned argument.\n\nYou're not doing that right.\n\nWhat?\n\nGimme.\n\nNo. Trust me.\n\nNo! I do this for my mom all the time.\n\nSee?\n\nWith the grain.\n\nWow, that is better.\n\nAnd someday, when you have varicose veins,\n\nI'll show you how to massage them.\n\nOh, God, never again.\n\nI assume by \"never again, \" you mean never again will you drink all of Penny's beer, then run down to the gas station for a couple of 40s, a box of Slim Jims and the latest issue of\n\nI was homesick.\n\nThe highlight of the evening was when you showed us your Bollywood break dancing skills.\n\nThat's very offensive.\n\nYeah, we all thought so.\n\nOh, no.\n\nWhat?\n\nIt's John and Yoko.\n\nMore like Yoko and Yoko.\n\nGreetings. Hey.\n\nI brought Amy here to show her some of the work I'm doing.\n\nIt's very impressive, for theoretical work.\n\nDo I detect a hint of condescension?\n\nI'm sorry, was I being too subtle?\n\nI meant compared to the real-world applications of neurobiology, theoretical physics is-- what's the word I'm looking for?-- hmm, cute.\n\nAre you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist like Babinski could ever rise to the significance of a physicist like\n\nClarke-Maxwell or Dirac?\n\nI'm stating it outright.\n\nBabinski eats Dirac for breakfast and defecates Clarke-Maxwell.\n\nYou take that back.\n\nAbsolutely not.\n\nMy colleagues and I are mapping the neurological substrates that subserve global information processing, which is required for all cognitive reasoning, including scientific inquiry, making my research ipso facto prior in the ordo cognoscendi.\n\nThat means it's better than his research, and by extension, of course, yours.\n\nI'm sorry, I'm-I'm still trying to work on the defecating\n\nClark Maxwell, so...\n\nExcuse me, but a grand unified theory, insofar as it explains everything, will ipso facto explain neurobiology.\n\nYes, but if I'm successful,\n\nI will be able to map and reproduce your thought processes in deriving a grand unified theory, and therefore, subsume your conclusions under my paradigm.\n\nThat's the rankest psychologism, and was conclusively revealed as hogwash by Gottlob Frege in the 1890s!\n\nWe appear to have reached an impasse.\n\nI agree.\n\nI move our relationship terminate immediately.\n\nSeconded.\n\nThere being no objections...\n\nUh-uh. ...the motion carries.\n\nGood day, Amy Farrah Fowler.\n\nGood day, Sheldon Cooper.\n\nWomen, huh?\n\nCan't live with them, can't successfully refute their hypotheses.\n\nAmen to that.\n\nHey, Sheldon.\n\nHello.\n\nI hear you broke up with Amy.\n\nA breakup would imply she was my girlfriend.\n\nShe was a girl who was my friend who is now a girl who is not my friend.\n\nWow. That's like the worst country song ever.\n\nSo, how are you doing?\n\nRegarding what?\n\nAmy.\n\nI don't follow.\n\nWell, breakups-- or whatever the hell this is-- can be tough.\n\nPenny, I assure you, I'm fine.\n\nMy relationship with Amy was purely intellectual,\n\nThere were no emotional bonds, the severing of which would cause me any discomfort.\n\nThe relationship simply outlived its utility, and I'm continuing on with my life as before.\n\nOkay. Good.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me,\n\nI'm off to buy a pussycat.\n\nI gotta tell you guys,\n\nI'm a little worried about Sheldon.\n\nWe're all a little worried about Sheldon.\n\nNo, I mean since the\n\nShamy hit a reef.\n\nOh, I thought you were just making a generalization: \"You know,\n\nI'm worried about Sheldon \"someday setting off a low-yield nuclear device because the cafeteria ran out of lime Jell-O.\"\n\nWhat does \"hit a reef\" mean?\n\nUh, went splitsville.\n\nPardon?\n\nTurned to boom-boom.\n\nAh.\n\nI think Sheldon really misses Amy.\n\nYou should lend him your copy of\n\nHe got a cat to keep him company.\n\nYou're kidding.\n\nHe takes it everywhere: to bed, to the bathroom.\n\nHe takes the kitty to the potty?\n\nI thought we discussed the P-word.\n\nDon't try to change me, dude.\n\nI am what I am.\n\nOh, gentlemen.\n\nHey. Aren't you going to introduce us to your little friend?\n\nMy apologies.\n\nRaj, Howard, I'd like you to meet Dr.\n\nRobert Oppenheimer.\n\nHello. Hi.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, the father of the atomic bomb wants a saucer of milk.\n\nOkay, I get it.\n\nWe're worried about Sheldon.\n\nYeah.\n\nHey.\n\nOh, no.\n\nRobert Oppenheimer was lonely.\n\nSo you decided to get the whole Manhattan Project? but he's so zazzy.\n\nOkay, we need to talk.\n\nAbout what?\n\nCats, Sheldon.\n\nYou're clearly upset about Amy being gone, and you're trying to replace her with a bunch of cats.\n\nClowder. What?\n\nA group of cats is a clowder.\n\nOr a glaring.\n\nOkay, yeah, fine.\n\nIt's the kind of thing you ought to know now that we have one.\n\nTerrific. My point is, you need to face up to what you're feeling with this breakup.\n\nIt wasn't a breakup.\n\nA breakup would imply that\n\nAmy was my girlfriend.\n\nOkay, I got it, I got it; she's not your girlfriend.\n\nNow listen to me.\n\nI know about loneliness.\n\nI know about trying to replace someone with other stuff.\n\nWhen I broke up with Penny,\n\nI got back into my cello,\n\nI built a bunch of model rockets,\n\nI got those weightlifting gloves and that five-pound dumbbell.\n\nYou didn't break up, she dumped you.\n\nShe didn't dump me.\n\nIt was mutual!\n\nI was there. She dumped you.\n\nOkay, fine.\n\nLive with cats.\n\nBe like my Aunt Nancy.\n\nShe had dozens of them.\n\nAnd do you know what happened after she died? They ate her.\n\nYou don't have to sell me on cats, Leonard.\n\nI'm already a fan.\n\nAll right, fellas, who's in the mood for Fancy Feast?\n\nWell, that's not fancy at all.\n\nHi, Mrs. Cooper. Thanks for coming.\n\nWhere is he?\n\nHe's in his bedroom.\n\nNow, when you said on the phone he broke up with a girl, you meant an actual girl, not something you kids whipped up in a lab?\n\nNo, she's real.\n\nDid they sin?\n\nNo, no, it's not like that.\n\nIt's, uh...\n\nI don't know what it's like.\n\nBut there is something I should prepare you for.\n\nOh, relax, Leonard,\n\nI have raised that boy.\n\nI've seen him at his best,\n\nI've seen him at his worst.\n\nThere's nothing he can do that'll surprise me.\n\nHold on to that thought.\n\nCome in.\n\nSurprise.\n\nMom, what an unexpected pleasure.\n\nMy, my, that's a powerful smell.\n\nI'd like you to meet Oppenheimer,\n\nFrisch, Panofsky,\n\nFeynman, Weisskopf...\n\nYeah, I get it.\n\nYou got a lot of cats and you gave 'em cute Jewish names.\n\nWhat are you doing here?\n\nLeonard called.\n\nAnd he said that you were pining for a young lady.\n\nOh, that's preposterous.\n\nI'm not pining over anyone.\n\nOh, lambchop, we can quibble what to call it, but I think we can both agree it's creepy.\n\nI do not agree.\n\nCats make wonderful companions.\n\nThey don't argue or question my intellectual authority, and this little guy here,\n\nI think you'll find to be quite zazzy.\n\nYou should have called sooner.\n\nShelly! Dinner's ready!\n\nComing!\n\nNo cats!\n\nAw...\n\nWhat is she doing here?\n\nI called her.\n\nYour mother thinks you might be losing your mind over me.\n\nAs a neurobiologist, I was curious.\n\nWell, rest assured, I am in full possession of my faculties.\n\nOh, God bless you, dear.\n\nSheldon, sit down. Let's talk.\n\nAll right, but you're not fooling me.\n\nWhenever you say we have to talk, it means you want me to listen.\n\nThen stop talking.\n\nYes, ma'am.\n\nNow, the reason I called Amy over was to find out what type of person she is.\n\nAnd after chatting a bit,\n\nI have to say that while she is a you two are definitely not suited for each other.\n\nThat's a peculiar conclusion.\n\nBy any standard,\n\nAmy is more similar to me than anyone I've ever met.\n\nOh, I'm sorry, Shelly,\n\nI can't see it.\n\nWell, whether you see it or not is irrelevant.\n\nI can't see subatomic particles, but nevertheless, they're there.\n\nExcellent point.\n\nA physics point.\n\nTouch\u00e9.\n\nWell, putting aside the pig Latin, it's a good thing that you two decided to end the relationship so I didn't have to end it for you.\n\nAmy, after consideration,\n\nI believe we may have acted rashly.\n\nI propose we resume our relationship and attempt to resolve our differences.\n\nI'll agree to that only if you'll stipulate that 80% of our difficulties were caused by you.\n\nI'll go as high as 40. Sixty-five.\n\nDone.\n\nYou understand that moving forward, we deal with the fact that my mother does not approve of you?\n\nI do. I find being cast in the role of bad girl oddly titillating.\n\nWould you like to see my cats?\n\nI would. I love cats.\n\nThey're the epitome of indifference.\n\nAh, then you may find\n\nZazzles a little cloying.\n\nI saw what you did there.\n\nHe thinks he's such a smarty pants.\n\nHe's no different from any man.\n\nYou tell 'em not to do something, that's all they want to do.\n\nIf I hadn't told my brother Stumpy not to clear out the wood chipper by hand, we'd still be calling him Edward.\n\nNow, don't you move.\n\nI'll bring over all the food.\n\nNo, no, no, I can do it.\n\nWell, isn't that sweet?

Yesterday, she asked, \"Why is Howard hiding under the table?\"\n\nShe saw that.\n\nNo, not at first.\n\nRight after I pointed it out.\n\nLet me ask you something else.\n\nIs she seeing anybody?\n\nNot that I know of.\n\nWhile we're on the subject, why did you guys break up anyway?\n\nI'd rather not say.\n\nIf you want my help,\n\nI've got to know what happened.\n\nBut it's embarrassing... that's what I'm counting on.\n\nSpill.\n\nYou know <i>World of Warcraft?</i>\n\nThe online game?\n\nSure.\n\nDid you know that the characters in the game can have sex with each other?\n\nOh, God.

\u266a\n\nKind of busy here, Sheldon.\n\nI know, that's why I shortened it.\n\nWhat do you want?\n\nI came to go over your alibi for last night.\n\nWhat alibi?\n\nYou've asked me to lie on your behalf, and as you know,\n\nI am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonesty, so I've provided you with an ironclad alibi.\n\nYou couldn't have spent last night with Priya because you were with another woman.\n\nOh, I'm so sure\n\nI'm gonna regret this, but who was I with?\n\nThe fun-loving and morally loose\n\nMiss Maggie McGarry.\n\nOh, God.\n\nYou met her at Pasadena's most popular Irish watering hole,\n\nLucky Baldwin's, where Maggie spends her nights tending bar with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams. \"Leonard, call me if you are interested in coitus.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMaggie McGarry.\"\n\nAnd if anyone were to actually call that number, they will hear this.\n\nFEMALE TEXT-TO-SPEECH VOICE:\n\nTop of the morning to you.\n\nYou've reached Maggie McGarry.\n\nLeave a message after the wee little beep.\n\nIt's pretty convincing, huh?\n\nThat wasn't even a real person.\n\nAnd here is the clincher: a lock of Maggie's flaming auburn hair.\n\nWhere'd you get that?\n\nFrom an orangutan in the primate lab.\n\nAn orangutan?\n\nWell, no one's going to run a DNA test on it, Leonard.\n\nHonestly, you overthink everything.\n\nSheldon, I don't need an alibi.\n\nNobody's going to ask about last night as long as you just zip your lip.\n\nThank you.\n\nNow, don't worry, everything is going to be fine.\n\nHey.\n\nHey, Leonard, will you please tell Howard my sister has never been attracted to him?\n\nCome on, Raj, how am I supposed to know who she is attracted to or was attracted to or who she might be attracted to in the future?\n\nAnd I have nothing to contribute to this conversation.\n\nBecause I, too, know absolutely nothing about Priya's preferences in male companionship.\n\nAnd with that,\n\nI will re-zip my lip.\n\nHey, so what did you guys think of the new episode of <i>Caprica</i> last night?\n\nI didn't see it.\n\nDidn't see it?\n\nWhat were you doing?\n\nUh, I was out.\n\nWhat, on <i>Caprica</i> night?\n\nYeah, I, uh, went for a drink.\n\nReally, you?\n\nWhere, w-where'd you go?\n\nTo, uh...\n\nLucky Baldwin's.\n\nOh, I've heard of that place.\n\nIsn't that Pasadena's favorite Irish watering hole?\n\nYes.\n\nDid you meet anyone interesting there, perhaps a promiscuous, redheaded barmaid?\n\nAs a matter of fact...\n\nI-I-I-I-I can't, I can't,\n\nI can't do it.\n\nSure you can, you're doing fine, it's very believable.\n\nI'm sorry, Raj, but the truth is,\n\nI was with Priya last night.\n\nDon't listen to him.\n\nHe's still light-headed from all the Irish whiskey and pickled eggs in his system.\n\nWhat were you doing with Priya?\n\nI believe they engaged in coitus, but more importantly, if Leonard had not abandoned his story, would you have found it plausible?\n\nYou slept with my sister?!\n\nYeah.\n\nHow could you?\n\nWe had a pact.\n\nExcuse me, I think \"How could you? She's my sister\" takes precedence over a five-year-old pinky swear.\n\nMay I point out, in a parallel universe, your friends are saying \"Maggie McGarry-- she sounds lovely.\"\n\nLook, I-I admit it, I may have crossed a line here, but come on, Raj, your sister is a grown woman, and to her, I'm a forbidden piece of white chocolate.\n\nKOOTHRAPPALI:\n\nI don't believe it.\n\nThis is a terrible betrayal of my trust.\n\nNo, w-w-would it help if I told you that I offered her my heart, and she kind of stomped on it?\n\nHow hard did she stomp?\n\nVery hard.\n\nOkay, I'm good.\n\nWell, Raj,\n\nI just want to say that I'd never betray your trust.\n\nUnlike Leonard,\n\nI respect you.\n\nReally?\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nWas it out of respect that you didn't tell Raj about the time you dropped his iPhone in a urinal?\n\nDude, I put that thing on my face!\n\nI think a more amusing violation of Raj's trust is when Howard convinced him that foreigners give presents to Americans on Thanksgiving.\n\nHey, I didn't see you giving back your Snoopy snow cone maker.\n\nThat was all a lie?\n\nThis year's gifts are already wrapped.\n\nAnd as long as we're talking about betraying our friends, how about the month Sheldon spent grinding up insects and mixing them into Leonard's food?\n\nSHELDON:\n\nWell, excuse me.\n\nThat was not a betrayal.\n\nThat was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting \"mothy.\"\n\nYou put moths in my food?!\n\nFor science.\n\nI can't believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth.\n\nWell, I can't believe you used Sheldon's toothbrush.\n\nYou used my toothbrush?\n\nNot the brush part, just the little rubber thing to pick food from my teeth and massage my gums.\n\nOkay, I-I think it's safe to say that we've all done some things we're not particularly proud of.\n\nBut come on, we're friends.\n\nFriends overlook each other's minor lapses.\n\nFor the record, Howard, I'm sorry that I broke our pact.\n\nThank you.\n\nAnd I'm sorry about your phone and Thanksgiving.\n\nAnd while we're at it, you don't have to wash our clothes on the Fourth of July.\n\nAs long as we're apologizing,\n\nSheldon, I'm, I'm sorry\n\nI used your toothbrush.\n\nAnd I'm sorry... but that behavior is beyond the pale and cannot be tolerated.\n\nWe are no longer friends.\n\nI got you a talking Thomas the\n\nTank Engine for Thanksgiving.\n\nWith real puffing smoke?\n\nYes.\n\nAll right.\n\nBut I'm watching you.\n\nHey, you've got Snoopy out.\n\nCan I have a snow cone?\n\nWell, sure.\n\nThis is pretty good.\n\nWhat flavor is this?\n\nGuess.\n\nPapaya?\n\nNo.\n\nGuava?\n\nYou're so close.\n\nI give up.\n\nMango caterpillar.\n\nWhat are you doing?!\n\nYou said you liked it.

Why can't you sleep?\n\nWho knows?\n\nI haven't watched any scary movies recently.\n\nI'm no longer obsessing over why the predicted mass of the quantum vacuum has little effect on the expansion of the universe.\n\nAnd it's been weeks since I took that accidental sip of Red Bull.\n\nDid something happen today that's bothering you?\n\nWell, I did mention the Mars Rover incident to that FBI agent and probably cost Howard his security clearance.\n\nWhat?\n\nBut why should that keep me up?\n\nBecause you feel guilty?\n\nInteresting.\n\nSo you're saying my insomnia is caused by a guilty conscience.\n\nActually, you don't have insomnia.\n\nYou're sleeping now.\n\nExcuse me?\n\nYou're having a guilt-ridden dream.\n\nDo you have any evidence to support that hypothesis?\n\nHow about that Gorn sitting on the couch?\n\nThat seems fairly conclusive.\n\nNo, Gorn, no.\n\nThat's where I sit.\n\nThank you for agreeing to see me, Agent Page.\n\nThank <i>you</i> for filing a complaint with my superior, Dr. Cooper.\n\nI understand you want to recant your statement about Howard Wolowitz.\n\nYes.\n\nWas your statement untrue?\n\nNo.\n\nThen I'm afraid you can't withdraw it.\n\nI'm sorry. I don't recall you saying \"no backsies.\"\n\nIs there anything else?\n\nYes. I'd like to offer a laudatory statement about Howard's many excellent qualities that I believe will tip the scales back in his favor. \"Howard Joel Wolowitz. \"H is for honesty, of which he has much. \"O's for outstanding, \"which he is such. \"W's for witty, he's quick with a joke.\n\nA's for artistic, his ability... \" I'm sorry.\n\nDr. Cooper, this matter is already closed.\n\nBut I still have \"rd Joel Wolowitz\" left to go.\n\nIt's closed.\n\nI don't understand why you people are picking on my friend, Howard, when there are much more serious security threats to pursue.\n\nFor instance, when I first met Leonard, he was on the verge of giving away rocket secrets to a North Korean spy, and not one agent ever investigated that.\n\nThis is Leonard Hofstadter?\n\nNo, it's a different Leonard.\n\nHe's...\n\nChinese, red hair, six fingers.\n\nGood-bye.\n\nRaj.\n\nHave you seen Howard?\n\nI think he's eating lunch.\n\nUh, Sheldon, I want you to meet Neil deGrasse Tyson from the Hayden Planetarium in New York.\n\nI'm quite familiar with Dr. Tyson.\n\nHe's responsible for the demotion of Pluto from planetary status.\n\nI liked Pluto.\n\nErgo I do not like you.\n\nBut I actually didn't demote Pluto.\n\nThat was a vote of the International\n\nAstronomical Union.\n\nIf \"ifs\" and \"buts\" were candy and nuts, we'd all have a merry Christmas.\n\nThink about that, Dr. Tyson.\n\nIs that the guy you were telling me about?\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nHoward.\n\nThe person at fault for you not getting a security clearance is me.\n\nYou?\n\nYes, but before you get upset,\n\nI want you to know\n\nI went to the FBI and retracted my statement.\n\nAnd they were okay with that?\n\nNo. If anything,\n\nI made it worse.\n\nIn any case, I have been riddled with guilt, which is causing\n\nGorn-infested REM sleep.\n\nSo, I'm here now to say I'm sorry.\n\nAre you kidding me?\n\nYou've set my career back at least two years, and you think you can make it right with \"I'm sorry\"?\n\nYes.\n\nI followed the social protocol.\n\nI attempted to right the wrong, and when I failed to do so,\n\nI delivered a heartfelt apology.\n\nNow you say, \"Apology accepted,\" and I will offer you a one-time-only high five.\n\nYour apology is not accepted.\n\nYou're tricking me.\n\nIt really is, isn't it?\n\nLeave me alone, Sheldon.\n\nDr. Cooper, I just wanted you to know\n\nI'm sorry for the role I played in the Pluto matter.\n\nOh, shut up.\n\nSheldon?\n\nHello.\n\nWhat are you doing here?\n\nI have troubles, Penny.\n\nI've come to pour them out to the sympathetic ear of the local barkeep.\n\nYou know, they have a really nice bar over at the Olive Garden.\n\nI don't like the Olive Garden.\n\nThey treat me like family.\n\nOkay, Sheldon.\n\nWhat can I get you?\n\nAlcohol.\n\nCould you be a little more specific?\n\nEthyl alcohol.\n\nI'm sorry, honey.\n\nI don't know milliliters.\n\nAh. Blame President James \"Jimmy\" Carter.\n\nHe started America on a path to the metric system but then just gave up.\n\nHe wonders why he was a one-term president.\n\nWould you say that's about 40 milliliters?\n\nMore or less.\n\nGreat.\n\nNow, where were we?\n\nI believe you were about to ask me to choose a cocktail.\n\nFortunately, thanks to computer-savvy alcoholics, there's an app for that.\n\nLet's see.\n\nHarvey Wallbanger. Eh.\n\nSex on the Beach.\n\nI hardly think so.\n\nRob Roy,\n\nSilk Slipper, Mad Hatter.\n\nOoh!\n\nI'll have a Rosewater Ricky.\n\nA what?\n\nYou'll need pitted, brandied cherries, gin, rosewater,\n\nAngostura bitters and overproofed rum.\n\nNow, first, dust the cherries with sugar, then spray them with a mixture of rum and bitters.\n\nThen ignite the rum, caramel...\n\nHere you go-- one\n\nRosewater Ricky.\n\nThat's not how it looks in the picture.\n\nOh, yeah, you know, every bartender makes it differently.\n\nWhy don't you give it a try.\n\nAll right.\n\nTo the metric system.\n\nI can't taste the cherries.\n\nAll right.\n\nSheldon, what's on your mind?\n\nI wronged Howard, and he won't accept my apology.\n\nOh, right, that.\n\nYes, Leonard told me.\n\nSorry, honey.\n\nPenny, you face failure on a daily basis.\n\nHow do you cope?\n\nI drink.\n\nTo drinking.\n\nNope.\n\nOh, if only there were some way to force Howard to accept my apology so I could escape this miasma of guilt.\n\nYou know, sometimes stuff just happens, and there's nothing you can do about it.\n\nFor example, Lisa Peterson hasn't talked to me since the 11th grade, because no matter how much you apologize, you can't go back and un-dry-hump someone's boyfriend.\n\nI see.\n\nYou're saying I'm facing\n\nStarfleet Academy's unwinnable command scenario: the Kobayashi Maru.\n\nExactly.\n\nSometimes you can't win.\n\nCaptain Kirk won.\n\nKirk cheated.\n\nImpressive that you know that.\n\nIt's hard to believe\n\nI'm actually having this conversation with you.\n\nRight there with you.\n\nKirk beat the Kobayashi Maru by reprogramming the simulator.\n\nThat's it.\n\nWhat?\n\nI'll reprogram Howard.\n\nWhat...?\n\nSheldon, you can't reprogram people.\n\nNo, <i>you</i> can't reprogram people.\n\nTo James Tiberius Kirk.\n\nHello, all.\n\nLEONARD: Hello.\n\nKOOTHRAPPALI: Hey.\n\nHoward, you're feeling better about me today, aren't you?\n\nNot really.\n\nYes, you are.\n\nI'm using neurolinguistic programming to modify your thought patterns.\n\nOh.\n\nGo away, Sheldon.\n\nThere's a $9.95 e-book down the drain.\n\nWhat's in the bag?\n\nIt's for Howard.\n\nOh. Sheldon, you can't fix this with gifts.\n\nNevertheless, I've hurt you, and whether you forgive me or not,\n\nI want you to have this.\n\nYou're giving me a couch cushion?\n\nNo.\n\nThe cushion is merely symbolic.\n\nI'm giving you my spot on the couch.\n\nBut you love that spot.\n\nNo. I love my mother.\n\nMy feelings for my spot are much greater.\n\nIt is the singular location in space around which revolves my entire universe.\n\nAnd now it's yours.\n\nOh, my God, dude.\n\nNow you have to forgive him.\n\nAll right.\n\nApology accepted.\n\nHigh five.\n\nNot too hard.\n\nThank you.\n\nI haven't cried like this since <i>Toy Story 3.</i>\n\nI got to tell you,\n\nSheldon, I understand why you chose this spot.\n\nI mean, the temperature is good, but there's no draft.\n\nI can see the television, but I can still talk to...\n\nI changed my mind.\n\nGet out of my spot.\n\nHow long?

Well, he waited in line for 14 hours, while you napped in a lawn chair, he got in a fight with a Klingon when he stepped out of line to pee and you wouldn't wake up to vouch for him, and worst of all, he saw <i>Star Trek: Nemesis.</i>\n\nBut how were our seats?\n\nExcellent.\n\nI rest my case.\n\nAmy, don't you agree we should leave now and get in line?\n\nActually, as the newest member of your social group,\n\nI believe I'll gain more acceptance by arbitrarily siding with your friends from time to time.\n\nShrewd.\n\nLeonard, you're right.\n\nWe should enjoy our meal, arrive late, and risk winding up with terrible seats, assuming we get in at all.\n\nThank you, Amy.\n\nSee?

Um, it was-- it was just going to be me and Bernadette.\n\nBesides, I thought you were going to the movies with Sheldon and the guys.\n\nYes, but they're not girls.\n\nI'm a girl.\n\nYeah, no, no,\n\nI-I-I got that.\n\nWhat's the dress code?\n\nUh, just wear something comfortable.\n\nAll right.\n\nI'll have to go shopping.\n\nKnock-knock.\n\nWho is there?\n\nHugh.\n\nHugh who?\n\nHugh people need to listen to me.\n\nIt's time to get in line for the movie.\n\nAnd that's how you tell a knock-knock joke.\n\nUnder normal circumstances\n\nI'd say, \"I told you so.\"\n\nBut as I have told you so with such vehemence and frequency already, the phrase has lost all meaning.\n\nTherefore, I will be replacing it with the phrase: \"I informed you thusly.\"\n\nOoh.

Well, I guess we're having a slumber party.\n\nOh!\n\nPillow fight!\n\nOh, I hope they let us in soon.\n\nI'm tired of running to the gas station to use the bathroom.\n\nThe guy makes me buy a Gatorade every time.\n\nIt's a vicious circle.\n\nToo bad you don't have a stadium pal like me.\n\nWhat's a stadium pal?\n\nLet me put it this way: takes care of the bathroom problem, and it keeps your calf warm.\n\nHey, guys, bad news.\n\nI just did a quick calculation.\n\nGiven the size of the theater and the length of this line, we might not get seats.\n\nWhat did he say?\n\nNice going, Raj.\n\nJust got him down for his nap.\n\nWe might not get seats?!\n\nIt's fine, it's fine.\n\nGo back to sleep.\n\nOh, I informed you thusly!\n\nI so informed you thusly.\n\nHoward, you talk to him.\n\nHoward?\n\nYou're peeing, aren't you?\n\nHey, look who's here!\n\nHey, buddies!\n\nWell, if it isn't Wil Wheaton, the Jar Jar Binks of the <i>Star Trek</i> universe.\n\nMee-sa think that very funny!\n\nWell, you-sa can go think that at the back of the line.\n\nNo cuts, no buts, no coconuts.\n\nWil Wheaton.\n\nYeah.\n\nI'm a big fan.\n\nOf what?

Come on,\n\nI'll hook you up.\n\nAwesome.\n\nWe-sa gonna go into the movie now! Bye-bye!\n\nThis is <i>Indiana</i> Jones, not <i>Star Trek.</i>\n\nThere should be no value to his pseudo-celebrity here!\n\nAnd even at\n\nStar Trek conventions, they only let him in if he helps set up!\n\nCalm down, Sheldon.\n\nI will not calm down.\n\nThis affront to justice and decency cannot go unanswered.\n\nAs Captain Jean-Luc Picard once said, \"The line must be drawn here! \"This far, no farther!\"\n\nHad to wake him up from his nap, didn't you?\n\nYou know what I really love about Howard?\n\nHis chest hair.\n\nHoward has a hairy chest?\n\nNo, just the one.\n\nBut it's really long.\n\nOkay, there you go--\n\nSultry Sunrise Red.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nMy nails have never looked so pretty before.\n\nGet it off.\n\nOh, oh, uh, looks like they're getting ready to let people in.\n\nListen to what Mr. Wil\n\nWheaton is tweeting. \"Best seats in house for <i>Raiders</i> screening.\n\nSuck on that, Sheldon Cooper.\"\n\nWhy do you read his Twitter feed?\n\nYou know it's only going to upset you.\n\nI believe in knowing my enemy, Leonard.\n\nHad Twitter existed at the time, would not General Custer have followed the tweets of Sitting Bull?\n\nWould not Lee have followed Grant?\n\nWould not Spy have followed Spy?\n\nI have more examples, but excuse me.\n\nHello.\n\nWell, this seems like an odd time to test my cell phone quality, but go on.\n\nTest phrases?

'Cause I'm the petty functionary with a clipboard, bitch.\n\nI guess that's that.\n\nLet's go home.\n\nYou know what?\n\nI'm going back to \"I told you so.\"\n\nI told you so.\n\nWe can still see something.\n\nOh, the new Sandra Bullock movie is playing two blocks away.\n\nYou know Sandy B. always brings it.\n\nLook-- a side door.\n\nCome on, Short Round.\n\nI guess we'd better go after him.\n\nShort Round?\n\nIndy's young sidekick from <i>Temple of Doom.</i>\n\nYeah, I know who it is, but why is it me?\n\nYou're right. It should be a cuddly Asian boy.\n\nLike me. \"And Absolon hath kist hir nether ye, \"and Nicholas is scalded in the towte.\n\nThis tale is doon, and God save al the rowte.\"\n\nWhat the hell was that?\n\nBernadette dared me to tell a dirty story. \"The Miller's Tale\" by Chaucer is the dirtiest story I know.\n\nIt would have been hidden in sock drawers if people in the 14th century had worn socks.\n\nI thought it was pretty spicy.\n\nEspecially the part where he kisses her nether ye.\n\nYou might not like it as much if you knew what \"nether ye\" meant. if one cares about hygiene, one ought not be kissing it.\n\nOkay, my turn.\n\nPenny, truth or dare?\n\nTruth.\n\nWhy are you still hanging out with Leonard so much even though you broke up with him?\n\nOh, that's an excellent question.\n\nFor two people who claim to be no longer pair-bonded, you spend an inordinate amount of time in each other's company.\n\nYeah.\n\nDare.\n\nI don't believe the rules allow for an ex post facto option change.\n\nYeah.\n\nOkay, look, just because we're not seeing each other anymore doesn't mean we can't be friends.\n\nI mean, Leonard's a great guy.\n\nThen, why did you terminate your relationship with him?\n\nI don't know.\n\nHe got really serious, and I wasn't ready for it.\n\nInteresting.\n\nHow will you react if, in the future, you become ready for it, and Leonard is unavailable, because another woman has realized that he is-- to use your words-- \"a great guy\"?\n\nYou can only ask one question.\n\nThat one.\n\nYou know what,\n\nI don't want to play anymore.\n\nWell, I'm not sure how this is scored, but I believe we may have won.\n\nSheldon?\n\nSheldon?\n\nWhere did he go?\n\nWe're looking for Sheldon, not Marmaduke.\n\nYou whistled?\n\nWhat is that? with 21 additional seconds.\n\nIf I can't see it, no one else can see it.\n\nSheldon, this is crazy.\n\nNo. Crazy was leaving the projection booth unattended.\n\nListen to me.\n\nYou are over-tired.\n\nYou're not thinking right.\n\nPut the movie back before we get into trouble.\n\nTrouble is my middle name,\n\nLeonard.\n\nActually, it's Lee, but I prefer Trouble.\n\nOh, look who they let in.\n\nDon't worry, Wil Wheaton.\n\nI was just leaving.\n\nCome on, Short Round.\n\nYeah.\n\nCome on, guys!\n\nHurry up! Hurry up!\n\nLet's see you run with a bag of urine strapped to your leg.\n\nHe's got the movie!

On the mouth.\n\nIs it possible that she was going for your cheek and you moved and she accidentally got lip?\n\nThat happens with me and my mom all the time.\n\nShe introduced me to her father, kissed me and then shut the door in my face.\n\nMaybe she was trying to send you a message.\n\nYou think?\n\nYeah. \"This man is not my father.\n\nI'm being held hostage.\n\nSo I'm going to do something insane in the hopes that you'll call 911.\"\n\nPenny kissing me is not insane.\n\nShe used to kiss me all the time.\n\nEinstein defined insanity as \"doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. \"\n\nBy that standard,\n\nPenny is cuckoo for cocoa puffs.\n\nI'm just saying, it felt like it may have meant something.\n\nAh, this takes me back.\n\nLeonard obsessing about Penny.\n\nI mean, don't get me wrong,\n\nI love your new stuff, but once in a while it's nice to hear the hits.\n\nOoh, ooh!\n\nDo \"Our babies will be smart and beautiful. \"\n\nThat one always makes me laugh.\n\nWhy do I bother talking to you people?\n\nIf it'll make you feel better, we rarely listen.\n\nHey, can I talk to you out here for a sec?\n\nYeah, sure.\n\nI'm starting to think we're never going to see that pizza.\n\nSo you're probably wondering what that was all about.\n\nWhat, uh, the kissing and everything?\n\nNah, women do that to me all the time.\n\nYeah, okay. The thing is, I kind of told my father we got back together again.\n\nWhat? Why?\n\nWell, you're the first guy he's ever really approved of, you know?\n\nYou're a scientist who went to college and you don't have a neck tattoo or outstanding warrants or... or a baby.\n\nWhat kind of guys did you used to go out with?\n\nJust guys.\n\nAnyway, when I told him we split up, he was heartbroken, and he kept bugging me: \"How's Leonard? why can't you get back together with Leonard?\n\nI bet Leonard never tipped a cow over on himself. \"\n\nSo to get him off my back,\n\nI told him we worked things out.\n\nReally?\n\nHow... how'd we manage that?\n\nWhat?\n\nI mean, did you apologize?\n\nDid you have to woo me?\n\nGet over yourself.\n\nI whistled, you came running.\n\nYeah, no, I don't think so.\n\nOkay, why are you arguing about this?\n\nI'm just saying, if we fake got back together, that's totally not how it fake happened.\n\nOh...\n\nOkay, whatever.\n\nWill you please just play along until my dad leaves?\n\nHold on, you actually want me to deceive your father with some sort of sham playacting and kissing?\n\nCause I'm good with that.\n\nPenny, you out here?\n\nCome on, honey, not in front of my dad.\n\nRelax, I've seen you do a lot worse with a lot stupider.\n\nSee?\n\nHe doesn't mind.\n\nSo, Leonard, I'm taking your gal out for a steak dinner, you want to join us?\n\nOh, dad, that's nice, but Leonard has to work.\n\nRight, Leonard?\n\nUh, I do, I have to work.\n\nBut I'm gonna blow that off to spend the evening with my sweetie and her father, 'cause, you know, just the kind of boyfriend I am.\n\nOh.\n\nCome here, you.\n\nC-7.\n\nMiss.\n\nHow could that be a miss?\n\nC-6 was a hit, c-8 was a hit.\n\nPart of your starship has to be on c-7.\n\nNot if it has a hole in the middle.\n\nWhat kind of spaceship has a hole in the middle?\n\nA romulan battle bagel?\n\nKnock-knock.\n\nOh, great, you made it.\n\nCome on in.\n\nI invited her.\n\nSo where's the telescope?\n\nIt's in hawaii, but Raj controls it from here.\n\nHe's hoping to see epsilon eridani dim, which would be evidence of a planet orbiting it.\n\nSo we just sit and stare at the screen, waiting for something to happen?\n\nI did it with you when we rented \"The Notebook\".\n\nYes, Gena Rowlands is a treasure.\n\nYou'd better open up that bottle of wine or I'm gonna end up with swimmer's ear.\n\nExcuse me.\n\nI can't be drinking, I'm about to make an important scientific discovery here.\n\nWhat? Galileo did his best work while drinking wine.\n\nHow do you know that?\n\nWell, he was Italian.\n\nIt's a reasonable assumption.\n\nDude, can you even open your mouth without spewing a cultural stereotype?\n\nOh, I... I'm sorry,\n\nGalileo drank diet sprite.\n\nLook, you're my best friend, she's my girlfriend, you should bond.\n\nYou know, like you and my mom did.\n\nYour mom creeps the hell out of me.\n\nYes, but she's stopped calling you slumdog millionaire.\n\nI do appreciate that.\n\nHere we go.\n\nI'd like to propose a toast.\n\nTo science and friendship.\n\nHold on. Wait.\n\nNo, it's okay, go ahead.\n\nWhat?\n\nOh, I was working with\n\nPenicillin-resistant gonorrhea in the lab today and I was just trying to remember if I washed my hands.\n\nThanks for the steak, Wyatt.\n\nMy pleasure.\n\nIt's nice to have dinner with a boyfriend of Penny's that knows how to use a napkin.\n\nSo not funny, dad.\n\nLet me tell you about this one genius she was going out with,\n\nThis... this fella Donnie.\n\nOh, will you please let it go?\n\nDonnie was gonna make millions turning farm waste into biofuel and selling it to the government.\n\nA lot of people are doing that.\n\nOh, see?\n\nYeah, but all Donnie did was mix pig poop with a little water and pump it into his mom's Camry.\n\nYeah, that's great.\n\nIt's a funny story. Moving on.\n\nAnd Donnie was a rocket scientist compared to that boy who wanted to get beer pong into the olympics.\n\nWhat was his name, sweetheart?\n\nCurtis, and I'm pretty sure he was joking.\n\nI don't know.\n\nThat petition looked real to me.\n\nYeah, okay, I think this ends the ex-boyfriend portion of our evening.\n\nWell, I'm just glad you finally found yourself a keeper.\n\nThanks, wyatt.\n\nI'm a keeper.\n\nLeonard, you want to come in for a nightcap?\n\nOh, gee, dad, he'd love to, but Leonard has to work in the morning.\n\nMaybe I could go in a little late.\n\nNo, no, no, you can't.\n\nYour career is far too important.\n\nBehind every great man is a nagging woman who won't let him have any fun, am I right, Leonard?\n\nDon't I know it.\n\nWell, good night, son.\n\nGood night, Wyatt.\n\nOh, good night, honey.\n\nGood night.\n\nI love you.\n\nLove you, too.\n\nOh, friggety-frak.\n\nNot this again.\n\nThree, four, five... pass go, get 2,000 Rupees...\n\nSix, seven.\n\nWhoops. Can't go any further.\n\nThere's a sacred cow in my way.\n\nBernadette, please tell your boyfriend to cool it with the cow jokes.\n\nIt won't help.\n\nOnce he finds a joke he likes, he sticks with it.\n\nYeah.\n\nLike his haircut material.\n\nOh, right. Did you get your hair cut? \"No. I got them all cut. \"\n\nWhich is still so funny.\n\nAnd when you go to a Chinese restaurant, he always gets the same fortune in his fortune cookie.\n\nRight. \"Help, I'm a prisoner in a Chinese fortune cookie factory. \"\n\nOkay, I think that's enough about me.\n\nHe's right. Let's make fun of his mother. \"Howard, come rub my feet!\n\nMy corns are killing me!\" \"Howard, help me out of the tub!\n\nI'm stuck again!\"\n\nComing.\n\nHey, lovebug.\n\nShut up.\n\nYou know what I've been doing for the last hour?\n\nMm, dreamily doodling \"Mrs. Leonard Hofstadter\" in a notebook?\n\nListening to my father go on and on about what a great guy you are.\n\nYou got to admit, I am... I'm delightful.\n\nWhy are you making this so difficult?\n\nIt's not difficult for me.\n\nI'm having fun.\n\nLeonard.\n\nWhat do you want me to do? You started this.\n\nDo you want to go over and tell him we're broken up?\n\nNo.\n\nWell, then, what do you want?\n\nI don't know.\n\nDon't you think that's something you should have figured out before you stomped over here?\n\nMaybe.\n\nLeonard, Penny, excellent.\n\nI'd like to say I'm very happy that you're back together, and if I can figure out a way to do so and sound sincere, I will.\n\nIn the meantime,\n\nI'd like to go over some proposed changes to the roommate agreement specifically to address\n\nPenny's annoying personal habits.\n\nOh, my God.\n\nWhat personal habits?\n\nI have a list.\n\nFYI, overuse of the phrase \"oh, my god\" is number 12.\n\nOkay, Sheldon, you don't have to do this because Leonard and I are not... - Ba-ba-ba-ba.\n\nAre you sure you want to include him in this?\n\nInclude me in what?\n\nIs there a plot afoot?\n\nI'll have no truck with plots.\n\nNo, you're right.\n\nNo, there's... There's no plots, no trucks, no feet.\n\nSo what other annoying habits shall we discuss?\n\nUh, we don't discuss anything.\n\nLeonard is the signatory to the Roommate Agreement.\n\nAs such, he bears responsibility for all your infractions and must pay all fines.\n\nFines?\n\nYes.\n\nIf Penny's going to be spending nights here again, you'll need to set up an escrow account.\n\nSign here.\n\nHello, Hawaii.\n\nThis is Dr. Koothrappali in Pasadena.\n\nI'd like you to reposition the telescope, please.\n\nScarlett Johansson's house!\n\nI'm kidding, Hawaii.\n\nMahalo.\n\nWhoo!\n\nIt might have been a mistake to open that second bottle of wine.\n\nWell, live and learn.\n\nSo, Raj, do you think this planet you're looking for could have an atmosphere that supports life?\n\nMaybe.\n\nIf it did, I'd be famous.\n\nI'd be on the cover of magazines.\n\nAnd then, instead of living alone in my tiny apartment,\n\nI'd have a big mansion.\n\nThat sounds great.\n\nIt is.\n\nIf you like wandering around a big, empty house with no one to love you.\n\nWe'd come visit you.\n\nNo, you wouldn't.\n\nYou'd be intimidated by my wealth and fame.\n\nMy only friends would be my genetically engineered monkey butler.\n\nAnd the little people I hired to be my living chess set.\n\nHe's taking a turn to the dark side, isn't he?\n\nHold on. He could come back.\n\nOh, what's the point of everything?\n\nNope. He's gone.\n\nYou know it's been more than a year since i've even kissed a girl?\n\nWhat about that hookup at\n\nComic-Con you told me about?\n\nOh, grow up. I was lying.\n\nI lie all the time.\n\nNobody wants to kiss me.\n\nOh, you poor, poor thing.\n\nRaj, you have to know you're a wonderful man.\n\nThere are a lot of girls out there who'll want to kiss you.\n\nWhere?\n\nYou just have to look.\n\nNo!\n\nWell, this was fun.\n\nOh! I think I got a nibble.\n\nOh, be careful.\n\nGive him some line.\n\nOkay, now reel him in.\n\nOh, look at that baby.\n\nThey're really biting, huh?\n\nYeah. They do that when you set it on easy.\n\nOh, that's me.\n\nHello.\n\nOh, hi, sweetie.\n\nYeah, I got up early and didn't want to wake you, so I went out for coffee and ran into Leonard on the way back.\n\nGuess what... We're fishing.\n\nYeah. Right here on his couch.\n\nHey, baby. I love you!\n\nThat's Leonard says he loves you.\n\nWhat?\n\nI see.\n\nThe whole thing's bull squirt, huh?\n\nWell, that's very disappointing.\n\nBye.\n\nOh, hey.\n\nThere's been something I've been meaning to tell you.\n\nI can't believe you would lie to me like that.\n\nJust for the record, I did not want to be a part of this.\n\nI'll get to you in a minute.\n\nNo hurry.\n\nThat my own daughter thinks\n\nI don't love her enough\n\nTo support her no matter what choices she makes...\n\nWell, that hurts me deeply.\n\nI'm sorry, daddy...\n\nLet me finish.\n\nOh.\n\nI thought we were past the days when you would try to pull the wool over my eyes.\n\nTelling me the baggie in your underwear drawer is potpourri?\n\nAnd the pee stick in your bathroom\n\nIs to check for diabetes?\n\nYou know, I'm sorry.\n\nYou're a grown woman, and I respect your right\n\nTo make your own decisions, but all I ask is you respect me enough to be honest about them.\n\nYou're right. Look, from now on, I will tell you the truth.\n\nThank you. Now, why don't you go and put some clothes on and we'll grab a bite to eat before I head for the airport.\n\nNow you.\n\nDaddy, he had nothing to do...\n\nKeep walking.\n\nOkay.\n\nPlease, please, please don't give up on her.\n\nWhat?\n\nI can't go back to the skateboard idiots, the white rappers and all those\n\nSweaty dumb-asses with their backwards hats.\n\nGee, I don't know if it's in the cards, sir.\n\nThen, stack the deck.\n\nCheat.\n\nLie. I don't care.\n\nI want grandkids before I die, and I want them to grow up in a house without wheels.\n\nI'll give it a shot.\n\nThank you.\n\nNow I'm going to do something here to help you along.\n\nExcuse me?\n\nJust don't panic.\n\nNow, get your sorry, lying ass out of my face and make sure I never see it again!\n\nOh, the reverse psychology thing.\n\nI see. That's very clever.\n\nDon't yap. Just get out.\n\nI'll friend you on Facebook.\n\nOh, there you are.\n\nJust so you know, I was up all night, but I have finally completed\n\nThe Penny-specific section of the new roommate agreement.\n\nYeah, well, not necessary.\n\nWe broke up again.\n\nDo you even think about other people, leonard?\n\nDo you?\n\nHey.\n\nOh, how'd it go last night?\n\nOh, you know.\n\nSame old, same old.\n\nLooked through a telescope, saw some stars.\n\nBig whoop.\n\nReally?\n\nYou waited months for time with that telescope.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nWhy? You writing a book?\n\nI'm going to propose a hypothesis.\n\nLast night, Raj accidentally made contact\n\nWith an alien civilization and has been ordered by the United States government\n\nTo keep it a secret.\n\nNothing happened.\n\nCan we please just change the subject?\n\nThat sounds rehearsed.\n\nWe are not alone.\n\nHey.\n\nHey.\n\nHello.\n\nHey.\n\nHey.\n\nYou get to play with raj's big telescope last night?\n\nWhoa.\n\nWhere did that come from?\n\nHe never touched my telescope.\n\nWay to go shutting up.\n\nI did shut up.

That's why\n\nI'm going to skip over it.\n\nAre you saying that Amy is... oh, what's the scientific word...\n\nForget science. She's horny.\n\nOh! Okay. Wow.\n\nIt's simple biology. There's nothing I can do about it.\n\nAre you sure?\n\nWhat are you suggesting?\n\nI'm suggesting there might be something you could do about...\n\nAmy's urges?\n\nIt's illegal to spay a human being.\n\nYeah.

No Superman, no Wonder Woman?\n\nAll we've got is a skinny Flash, an Indian Aquaman, a nearsighted\n\nGreen Lantern, and a teeny, tiny\n\nDark Knight.\n\nObviously, we're no longer a Justice League.\n\nWe have no choice but to switch to our Muppet Baby costumes.\n\nOoh, I call Kermit.\n\nI'm Kermit.\n\nYou're Scooter.\n\nOh, man.\n\nScooter sucks.\n\nHe's the Aquaman of the Muppet Babies.\n\nNo, we can still make this work.\n\nLeonard, you talk to Penny.\n\nWhat makes you think\n\nI can convince her?\n\nYou got her to have sex with you.\n\nObviously, your superpower is brainwashing.\n\nOkay, let me see if I understand this.\n\nYou want me to convince my ex-girlfriend to go to a costume party with her new boyfriend just so we can win a stupid prize?\n\nYes. And make her wear the black wig. Good luck.\n\nGo away, Sheldon.\n\nIt's Leonard.\n\nOh.\n\nGo away, Leonard.\n\nCome on, let me just talk to you.\n\nIt's open.\n\nHey.\n\nI'm not going to that party, Leonard.\n\nOkay, listen.\n\nYou don't have to wear the wig.\n\nAt this party, we're gonna win first prize just by showing up with a girl.\n\nIt's not the wig.\n\nDid I do something?\n\nI mean, I tried to be friends with Zack, like you said, which believe me, was difficult, given how you and me used to be... you know, \"you and me,\" and now you and him are \"you and him.\"\n\nOkay, look.\n\nWe're not really \"me and him.\"\n\nThen what are you?\n\nI don't know.\n\nI only started seeing Zack again so I wouldn't be alone on New Year's Eve.\n\nHow pathetic is that?\n\nNot as pathetic as dressing up like this and going to a comic book store on New Year's Eve.\n\nYou make a cute Green Arrow.\n\nGreen Lantern.\n\nLike there's a difference.\n\nThere's a big difference.\n\nArrow.\n\nLantern.\n\nWhatever. Look, if Zack and I had just gone to a regular club or a party, it would have been fine, but this, with the costumes, and you...\n\nWhat about me?\n\nNothing.\n\nLet's go to the party.\n\nHow do I look?\n\nUm...\n\nI guarantee you'll be the prettiest girl there.\n\nOkay, the good news is, we have a Wonder Woman.\n\nOh.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat's the bad news?\n\nSuperman probably isn't getting laid tonight.\n\nAw, damn.\n\nAnd the award for best group costume goes to...\n\nJustice League of America...\n\nNumber three!\n\nThank you!\n\nThank you so much!\n\nOkay. Okay, ten seconds to midnight.\n\nTen, nine, eight...\n\nNo, wait!\n\nI have a speech.\n\nSeven, six...\n\nStop counting!\n\nFive, four, three...\n\nThis is my moment, dag nab it!\n\nTwo, one!\n\nHappy New Year!\n\nI'm not going to say another word until you people settle down.\n\nI'm waiting.\n\nThat was a great party.\n\nWe should dress like this all the time.\n\nAre you high?\n\nYou're being a bully.\n\nCheck it out.\n\nThose guys are breaking into that car.\n\nWhat should we do?\n\nWe're the Justice League of America.\n\nThere's only one thing we can do.\n\nTurn around and slowly walk away.\n\nNah.\n\nHold up.\n\nLook, I know our winter thermostat setting is 72 degrees, but I'm a little warm, so I'm going to turn it down.\n\nGood Lord, how you frustrate me,\n\nLeonard Hofstadter! == Sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> == == for <font color=#00FFFF>www.addic7ed.com</font> ==\n\nFine.\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "403960f3-bd94-45b4-a1de-6e6cd071efc0": {"__data__": {"id_": "403960f3-bd94-45b4-a1de-6e6cd071efc0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "91b4309dd6b344b622a6f499d41e191478e886dc9679551cd59313d6aee13569", "text": "\n\nMa, Ma, calm down.\n\nListen to me.\n\nI know it says click with the mouse, but on a laptop, the trackpad is the mouse.\n\nNow, put your finger on it.\n\nDoesn't matter which finger.\n\nGood choice.\n\nNow move it down to your e-mail icon.\n\nYeah, the little envelope.\n\nWhat do you mean, \"What does it look like ?\"\n\nIt looks like an envelope !\n\nFine, you don't like the computer, don't use it !\n\nSure, we can exchange it for a salad spinner.

Howard ?\n\nLike I was saying, right now it's just a dummy procedure, but eventually, it will drop us into...\n\nAll right, fine.\n\nIf we're not going to give it a name, can we at least give it a secret code designation ?\n\nNo.\n\nHear me out.\n\nThe atomic bomb was The Manhattan Project.\n\nWindows 95 was originally\n\nProject Chicago.\n\nFor our app, I would humbly suggest Project Nodlehs.\n\nThat's just \"Sheldon\" backwards.\n\nAnother happy accident.\n\nWe're not wasting time with names right now.\n\nI see.\n\nIs that decision open for discussion ?\n\nNo.\n\nIs the decision to not discuss it open for discussion ? \n\nNo.\n\nAgain, right now it's just a dummy procedure, but eventually, it will drop us into...\n\nI call for a vote of no confidence and an immediate change in leadership.\n\nSheldon, stop it.\n\nWhen in the course of human events, it becomes necessary to dissolve the bonds that tie three competent scientists together...\n\nThat's enough, Sheldon.\n\nAll right, let's get right to the vote.\n\nShow of hands-- all those opposed to Leonard and his reign of tyranny.\n\nOkay, that's it, you're fired.\n\nReally ?\n\nWhy ?\n\nBecause you're impossible to work with.\n\nI see.\n\nAnd is that open for discussion ?\n\nWhat are you doing ?\n\nOh. Good morning, shoemaker.\n\nI think you'll be pleased with what the elves were up to last night.\n\nI fired you.\n\nOh, I know. I'm now an independent contractor.\n\nNo, you are now nothing.\n\nYou have no connection to this project whatsoever.\n\nBut I made it better.\n\nI don't want it better.\n\nI want it my way.\n\nWell, that speaks volumes, doesn't it?\n\nAll right, I suppose\n\nI'll go put on my bus pants.\n\nWhat the hell are bus pants ?\n\nThey are pants one wears over one's regular pants when one sits on bus seats that other people have previously sat on.\n\nBut perhaps from your lofty heights atop the corporate ladder, you've lost touch with the struggles of the common man.\n\nLook, I'm still happy to drive you to work.\n\nNothing's changed in that regard.\n\nWe're still roommates, we're still friends.\n\nExcept you identified me, your best friend, as a gangrenous limb that needed to be severed from the organism and tossed away.\n\nThe desperate act of a little man with a big Napoleon complex.\n\nYou know what?\n\nGo put on your bus pants.\n\nMm. Last night,\n\nI had a dream we got so rich from the app, you and I bought matching side-by-side mansions.\n\nBut... there was a secret tunnel connecting your front yard to my back yard.\n\nWhat do you think that means?\n\nIt means after we play handball,\n\nI'm showering at home.\n\nGood morning, Friend Howard.\n\nFriend Raj.\n\nI see you gentlemen are enjoying beverages.\n\nPerhaps they would taste better out of these. \"World's Greatest\n\nAstrophysicist\" ?\n\nDon't thank me. You earned it. \"Howard Wolowitz.\"\n\nWhy not \"World's Greatest Engineer\" ?\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nI typed that into the label maker, but I just couldn't press enter.\n\nNow down to business.\n\nWhat would it take for you to abandon Leonard and join me in a rival company ?\n\nUnless, of course, the mugs are sufficient, in which case, welcome aboard.\n\nWe're not quitting on Leonard.\n\nI understand.\n\nYour loyalty is admirable.\n\nBut what if I were to up the ante ?\n\nWhat are you talking about ?\n\nMonogrammed key chains with a built-in laser pointer.\n\nNo ?\n\nHow about can cozies emblazoned with our university mascot ?\n\nGo, Beavers.\n\nI'll be back.\n\nOkay, let's try this one. \"Spherical Hankel function.\"\n\nHold on.\n\nThat's it !\n\nEureka !\n\nHey, we agreed when it was \"Eureka\" time, we were all gonna say it together.\n\nFine.\n\nLet's say it together.\n\nNo. The moment has passed.\n\nGreetings, gentlemen.\n\nHow goes your little project ?\n\nYou mean, \"Project Lenwoloppali\" ?\n\nAh, a combination of all your names.\n\nVery clever.\n\nI assume \"Koothranardowitz\" was taken ?\n\nWe're actually scanning equations and getting good results.\n\nOh, well then, by all means, carry on.\n\nI wouldn't want to impede your progress.\n\nHoward, did you solve the install time problem yet?\n\nNo. It's a little tricky.\n\nI'm gonna try having it pick up the libraries dyn...\n\nWhat are you doing ?!\n\nPlaying the theremin.\n\nNo. I mean, what are you doing with a theremin ?\n\nPlaying it.\n\nI've loved the theremin from the first moment\n\nI heard the original\n\nAnd it's been killing me that it just sits in my closet, gathering dust.\n\nSheldon!\n\nWe're working here!\n\nThat's all right.\n\nI can barely hear you over my theremin.\n\nWell, that was a little uncalled for.\n\nNo, that was completely called for.\n\nWe need quiet.\n\nSo, your project is more important than mine?\n\nWell, seeing as your project is to sabotage my project, yes.\n\nDon't beat around the bush,\n\nLeonard.\n\nIf you don't want me here, just say the word, and I'll leave.\n\nCould have beaten around the bush a little. \u266a Nobody knows \u266a \u266a The trouble I've seen \u266a \u266a Nobody knows my sorrow \u266a \u266a Oh, oh, oh. \u266a\n\nWhat you doing?\n\nTrying to contact your home planet?\n\nI'm practicing my theremin.\n\nOh. \u266a Nobody knows \u266a \u266a The trouble I've seen \u266a \u266a Glory, hallelujah. \u266a\n\nSomething got you down, there, Sheldon?\n\nLeonard kicked me out of my own apartment.\n\nAnd his app team.\n\nOh, honey, I'm sorry.\n\nHe wouldn't drive me to work today.\n\nI had to wear my bus pants.\n\nIs that so?\n\nYes.\n\nAnd they're still sticky.\n\nAw...\n\nProbably going to have to throw them away.\n\nHey, you don't need\n\nLeonard and his app.\n\nYou can make one with me.\n\nWith you?\n\nSeriously,\n\nI have a great idea for one.\n\nIs it better than your idea to move to Los Angeles and become a famous actress?\n\nOkay, look... when you see someone wearing shoes you like, you just snap a picture of them, and the app goes on the Internet to find out where you can buy them.\n\nThat's your app idea ?\n\nWell, you don't like it ?\n\nI didn't say that.\n\nBut no, I don't.\n\nWhy not ?\n\nOh, Penny, where do I begin ?\n\nThe simple-mindedness of your idea is exceeded only by its crass consumerism and banality.\n\nAnd Leonard didn't want to work with you ?\n\nImagine that.\n\nI know, it's baffling. \u266a Nobody knows \u266a \u266a The trouble I've seen... \u266a\n\nSheldon, I'm gonna make some cocoa.\n\nDo you want some ?\n\nDo you make it with milk or water ?\n\nMilk.\n\nReal cocoa ?\n\nThat's what it says on the packet.\n\nDo you have those little marshmallows ?\n\nNo, sorry.\n\nWell, I suppose it's appropriate.\n\nWhat does that mean ?\n\nA disappointing drink for a disappointing day.\n\nHey, look at this. have already signed up for our private beta.\n\nI'm telling you, the Lenwoloppali\n\nDifferential Equation Scanner meets a real need.\n\nWe've got a hit.\n\nWhat do you think we should sell it for?\n\nWell, based on the fact that our potential market is about 70 or 80 guys, and you want a submarine,\n\nI'd say about a million dollars a pop.\n\nWell, what if we put out a lite version for half a million ?\n\nYou know, get the word of mouth going.\n\nHi. I'm sorry to bother you guys, but you've got to come take your Sheldon back.\n\nWhat's he doing in your apartment ?\n\nWell, he was moping down in the lobby, so I invited him over.\n\nNow I regret it.\n\nWhy do you regret...\n\nUh, never mind, stupid question.\n\nLook, can't you just let him play with you until bedtime ?\n\nWe're not playing.\n\nThis is real work.\n\nWe're going to be hundred-aires.\n\nOkay. What if I got him to apologize and promise to behave ?\n\nThen I guess we would let him back on the app team, and while we're doing that, you could take an aerial tour of L.A. on your flying pig.\n\nOkay. Wait right here.\n\nI'll tell you one thing.\n\nIf I get rich enough, that's the kind of girl I want to take on a submarine ride.\n\nAnd yes, that time,\n\nI meant it to be dirty.\n\nReally?\n\nLeonard wants me back ?\n\nOh, yes. He says they are lost without you.\n\nWell, we sure saw that coming.\n\nThat's right.\n\nYou know what\n\nI'm going to do?\n\nI am going to sit here and just let them stew.\n\nNo, no, no. You know, they have suffered enough.\n\nEverybody's suffered enough.\n\nThe thing is, you're going to have to offer him a face-saving way out of this.\n\nHow?\n\nSay you're sorry.\n\nOh, no.\n\nMrs. Mary Cooper didn't raise her no liars.\n\nOkay. Um...\n\nHow about this ? You know how you're always trying to learn about sarcasm ?\n\nNo.\n\nNo ?\n\nI was being sarcastic.\n\nOh. Good for you.\n\nSo all you have to do here is say you're sorry to Leonard, but say it sarcastically.\n\nOf course.\n\nHe will hear it as an attempt to mend fences, as opposed to the withering condemnation you and I will know it to be.\n\nYeah. Yeah, that was my plan.\n\nAll right.\n\nCome on. Let's go.\n\nOh, by the way, thank you for the delicious cocoa.\n\nOh, you're welcome.\n\nBoy, I'm getting good at this.\n\nOkay, now that you're back on the team, let's get you caught up.\n\nBefore you begin, let me say again how deeply sorry I am for my earlier behavior and how much I respect and admire your leadership.\n\nThank you.\n\nSo as you can see, not only can you store your favorite equations, but you can forward them to your friends or post them on Facebook right from the app.\n\nWell, I must say,\n\nI am impressed.\n\nThanks.\n\nYou all have clearly put in a lot of hard work.\n\nWe have.\n\nAs a result, you have taken the most important step on the road to success : learning what not to do.\n\nNow, let's start fresh.\n\nHoward, we're going to need some tea.\n\nOkay, these are Uggs.\n\nThese are Crocs.\n\nThese are knockoff\n\nManolo Blahniks.\n\nBored.\n\nLook, you said it yourself, we have to create a database before you can write an alga-thingy.\n\nAlgorithm.\n\nYou see, Penny, Alan Turing defined an algorithm...\n\nBored.\n\nOkay.\n\nThese are Steve Maddens.\n\nThese are Nine West.\n\nThese are Target.

We have seven people, and two cars.\n\nIn the lead car, driven by leonard,\n\nWill be... Myself,\n\nAmy farrah fowler,\n\nAnd penny.\n\nYes!\n\nHe had you in the other car, but I got you upgraded.\n\nYay!\n\nShe made the case that if we break down\n\nIn the middle of nowhere, your nebraska backwoods skills\n\nAnd brawny hands will give us the best chance\n\nTo survive in the wild.\n\nBrawny?\n\nThey're bigger than mine.\n\nRed leader to red five, come in.\n\nRed leader to red five, come in.\n\nHoward, you promised.\n\nWolowitz (on radio):\n\nFine. Red five to red leader.\n\nWhat do you want now?\n\nIt's 11:15. I'm requesting your quarter-hourly location update.\n\nStill right behind you.\n\nCopy that, red five.\n\nRadio contact is sufficient.\n\nNo need to extend your middle finger.\n\nSo, amy, I've been wondering,\n\nAre you and sheldon going to be sharing a room?\n\nNo, we discussed it.\n\nWe decided we didn't want to jeopardize our relationship\n\nBy getting to know each other too well.\n\nIndeed. Nothing sours a friendship more\n\nThan over-familiarity with someone's toilet routine.\n\nI can vouch for that.\n\nHey.\n\nNot you, him.\n\nOh. Thanks.\n\nAlthough yours was an eye-opener.\n\nDon't worry, penny.\n\nYou're my plus-one.\n\nYou'll bunk with me.\n\nAnd fyi, travel makes me constipated,\n\nSo I'm the ideal hotel roommate.\n\nTerrific.\n\nAre we there yet?\n\nI hope we get there in time to see the keynote address.\n\nReally? You want to see the keynote?\n\nYeah, it sounds fun. \"super bacteria:\n\nGlobal apocalypse or exciting research opportunity?\"\n\nActually, I was thinking we could go straight to the room\n\nAnd... Take a nap.\n\nReally?\n\nAnd miss the keynote?\n\nWe can watch it later on c-span.\n\nBesides, I was really looking forward to you and me...\n\nNapping together in the hotel.\n\nHoney, if you're that tired,\n\nWhy don't you just take a nap here in the car?\n\nNo, see, it's not...\n\nHang on.\n\nIt's leonard.\n\nHi, leonard.\n\nLeonard (on speaker):\n\nYeah, hi. Listen, I just got a text from raj.\n\nHe wanted me to tell you\n\nThat when howard says \"nap,\" he means \"sex.\"\n\nThank you, raj.\n\nAre you... An element in the actinoid series?\n\nNo.\n\nAmy?\n\nAre you usually radioactive when found in nature?\n\nNo.\n\nAre you in the lanthanoid series?\n\nAmy, it's penny's turn.\n\nPenny?\n\nUh, I don't know...\n\nAre you food?\n\nThat's not apropos.\n\nWe've already established\n\nI'm found in the periodic table.\n\nWell, it's a table, right?\n\nI mean, why can't there be food on it?\n\nI knew she wasn't lead car materiel.\n\nWho elected you road trip god?\n\nLeonard.\n\nIt was a late-night vote.\n\nWe were all exhausted,\n\nAnd he was threatening to filibuster.\n\nIt's not technically \"road trip god\"\"\n\nIt's travel supervisor.\n\nAlthough road trip god does have a certain ring to it.\n\nI don't understand why you people\n\nJust let him bully you like this.\n\nSomeone should stand up to him.\n\nWhat's he going to do?\n\nI can't believe you let him kick me out of the car.\n\nWhat could we do?\n\nHe's the travel supervisor.\n\nDon't worry, penny.\n\nThis is a better car anyway.\n\nYeah. It's the love car.\n\nShould I ask?  they say we're young and we don't know   we won't find out until we grow   well, I don't know if all that's true   'cause you got me, and, baby, I got you   babe   mm da-da, da-da, da-da \n\nBoth:  I got you, babe \n\nRed leader, I'm really sorry.\n\nBoth:  I got you, babe. \n\nWolowitz and bernadette:  I got you, babe... \n\nI missed you.\n\nYou know what?\n\nI missed you, too.\n\nBernadette?\n\nOh, my god, glenn!\n\nGreat to see you!\n\nAre you here for the conference?\n\nYeah, I'm doing a global warming panel.\n\nOh, good for you.\n\nUh, glenn, this is my boyfriend howard.\n\nNice to meet you.\n\nHi.\n\nOw. Hi.\n\nYou're a lucky man.\n\nBernie's a great gal.\n\nYes. \"bernie\" sure is.\n\nWell, I got to run.\n\nThe panel's tomorrow morning.\n\nIt's called, \"remembering snow:\n\nA look back.\"\n\nI'll try to catch it.\n\nOh, great.\n\nBye.\n\nBye.\n\nHey... Bernie?\n\nYeah?\n\nPlease tell me he's your gay cousin.\n\nNo.\n\nHe was one of my professors in college.\n\nOh! That's a relief.\n\nThen we went out for a year.\n\nCome on, let's check in, so we can take that nap.\n\nNo, it's not necessarily proportional...\n\nShut up!\n\nThat green bag is dr. Cooper's.\n\nHere's an extra five.\n\nMake him wait.\n\nOh.\n\nRight to the nap, huh? Okay?\n\nUh, so, this glenn guy.\n\nYou say you went out with him for, like, a year.\n\nDo we really need to talk about my old boyfriend now?\n\nNo. I guess not.\n\nWhat is he, like, six-four, six-five?\n\nSix-seven.\n\nProbably has a hard time finding a suit that fits.\n\nIs something bothering you?\n\nNo. It's just...\n\nWhat?\n\nI'm just thinking.\n\nIf you had sex with that guy,\n\nI mean, there's nothing\n\nI can do here\n\nThat will make any kind of... Impact.\n\nHoward, it's not a contest.\n\nI love you.\n\nI want to be with you.\n\nYeah, great, love you, too, but...\n\nIf it were a contest,\n\nI wouldn't have a chance, right?\n\nYou can't think that way.\n\nYep.\n\nLoser.\n\nHoward, stop it.\n\nSorry. I just never figured that\n\nA guy like me going out with a girl like you\n\nWould ever have to compete with a guy like that.\n\nWait a minute, \"a girl like me\"?\n\nWhat's that mean?\n\nI'm... I...\n\nAre you saying you don't think I'm hot enough\n\nTo go out with a guy like glenn?\n\nNo! No, I'm saying exactly the opposite.\n\nI'm <i>too</i> hot to go out with a guy like glenn?\n\nYeah, let's go with that.\n\nStill nothing.\n\nRemind me to try again in an hour.\n\nWill do.\n\nSo...\n\nGirl talk?\n\nUm, sure.\n\nWhat do you got in mind?\n\nDo you subscribe to the freudian theory of penis envy?\n\nUm, I never really thought about it.\n\nWhy?\n\nSometimes I think it might be nice to have one.\n\nReally?\n\nNot for sex, for convenience.\n\nYou can't deny that, by comparison,\n\nOur internal plumbing is extremely high maintenance.\n\nAgain, I've never given it much thought.\n\nWe have time now.\n\nThink about it.\n\nOh, good.\n\nHey.\n\nCan I stay here tonight?\n\nYeah. Why, what happened?\n\nHoward's a complete and total ass.\n\nOh, yeah, that.\n\nCome on in.\n\nThanks. I'll sleep on the floor.\n\nNot necessary.\n\nPenny and I are perfectly comfortable sharing a bed.\n\nWe are?\n\nOf course, we're best friends.\n\nOh, right, right, the blog.\n\nWord of warning, though.\n\nI'm prone to night terrors,\n\nSo when I wake up kicking and screaming, don't panic.\n\nJust pin me down and stroke my hair, and I'll be fine.\n\nHey, can I stay here tonight?\n\nShh-shh-shh.\n\nSheldon's asleep.\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nWell, howard's a complete and total ass,\n\nBernadette's in my bed,\n\nAnd no matter how much you stroke amy's hair, she bites.\n\nWhat?\n\nNever mind.\n\nCan I stay here or not?\n\nUh, sure.\n\nAll right.\n\nSo, how do you want to do this?\n\nWell, I'm not getting in bed with <i>him.</i>\n\nYeah, it is a little like\n\nGetting into dracula's coffin.\n\nWe're just gonna have to make the best of this.\n\nOkay, when you say \"make the best of it...\"\n\nSleep.\n\nRight.\n\nSo we'll just call the middle here\n\nThe neutral zone.\n\nThe what?\n\nYou know, the neutral zone\n\nBetween the federation and the romulan empire.\n\nOh, okay.\n\nJust like old times.\n\nOf course,\n\nSometimes the federation and the romulans\n\nWould enter the neutral zone\n\nTo negotiate a temporary truce.\n\nSweetie, let me put this in a way you'll understand:\n\nFrom the waist down, my shields are up.\n\nGot it, got it.\n\nWe can do all kinds of stuff\n\nFrom the waist up, you know?\n\nGo to sleep.\n\nGood night.\n\nPlease tell me you're not having coitus.\n\nWe are not having coitus.\n\nCan you guarantee that it won't happen\n\nAt any time during the night?\n\nYes.\n\nNo.\n\nAnnouncer (on tv):\n\nNext on turner classic movies,\n\nOh, my god, I'm crying already.\n\nSheldon:\n\nRaj? Raj?\n\nRaj?\n\nI need to sleep here tonight.\n\nWhy?\n\nHoward is a complete and total ass,\n\nBernadette is in penny's bed, amy bites,\n\nAnd penny may or may not have coitus with leonard.\n\nOkay. Come on in.\n\nLeonard, are you asleep?\n\nNo.\n\nI really appreciate you letting me stay here tonight.\n\nSure, no problem.\n\nI know it's kinda weird.\n\nTrue dat. \"true dat\"?\n\nI've gotten a lot more street since we broke up.\n\nRight.\n\nStill mad at me about that?\n\nNo. No, I understand.\n\nI got too intense, you had to back off.\n\nThank you.\n\nI've gotten a lot better at that, you know.\n\nI've dated four different women since we broke up\n\nAnd I didn't tell any of them that I loved them\n\nAnd wanted to have their babies.\n\nGood for you.\n\nOkay, good night.\n\nGood night.\n\nYou know, maybe it wouldn't be the worst idea in the world\n\nTo violate the neutral zone for just one night.\n\nOh!\n\nHey, leonard, sheldon kicked me\n\nOut of the room, gave me your key.\n\nPenny's here.\n\nNo, we don't want to watch bridget jones's diary!\n\nGood morning and welcome to science and society.\n\nI'm dr. Sheldon cooper, bs, ms, ma, phd, and scd.\n\nOmg, right?\n\nPerhaps that joke was a little too hippie-dippy for this crowd.\n\nAll right then, we'll begin with opening remarks.\n\nMiss rostenkowski, would you like to start us off\n\nBy discussing your assessment\n\nOf science's responsibility to society?\n\nSure.\n\nI think all branches of science\n\nHave to move cautiously these days.\n\nIt's not just giant nuclear weapons\n\nThat can destroy the world.\n\nAs a microbiologist,\n\nI can tell you\n\nEven the tiniest organisms can still tear you a new one.\n\nInteresting.\n\nI think what you might need to know about my colleague\n\nIs that though she claims her field of interest is tiny organisms,\n\nShe certainly has spent her fair share of time\n\nAround what we can assume was pretty massive weaponry.\n\nI think mr. Wolowitz needs to keep in mind\n\nThat the past is the past.\n\nBut he should know that I <i>am</i> the kind of girl\n\nWho could get <i>all</i> the giant missiles she wants.\n\nAre we talking about women wanting penises?\n\nBecause I'd like to weigh in.\n\nDr. Koothrappali, would you care to join the conversation?\n\nCertainly.\n\nI'd like to raise two points.\n\nNumber one, I think they <i>are</i> talking about penises.\n\nAnd number two, these mimosas are kicking my little brown ass.\n\nI'd like to kick your little brown ass.\n\nWhat did I do?\n\nOh, I don't know.\n\nMaybe when you walk into a hotel room\n\nAnd you see a guy getting back together with his girlfriend,\n\nYou should consider doing something other\n\nThan crawling into the adjoining bed.\n\nI did. You said no\n\nPenny:\n\nWe weren't getting back together!\n\nIt was a one-time thing!\n\nExcuse me.\n\nWe're not taking comments or questions\n\nFrom the audience just yet.\n\nOh, shut up, sheldon!\n\nHi, bestie.\n\nAll right,\n\nWhy don't we see if we can bring this back to topic.\n\nLet me ask you something, bernie.\n\nI guess not.\n\nHow would you feel if you met <i>my</i> ex-girlfriend\n\nAnd she was like angelina jolie?\n\nOh, come on, howard, be realistic.\n\nWhat, I'm not hot enough for angelina jolie?\n\nI'd like to weigh in here.\n\nNo.\n\nAll right, why don't we open it up\n\nTo q&a from the audience?\n\nPenny:\n\nYeah, I have a question.\n\nIs there anybody who can get me the hell out of here\n\nAnd back to los angeles tonight?\n\nGlenn:\n\nI'm driving back to l.A. Tonight.\n\nPenny, that's glenn.\n\nGlenn, that's penny.\n\nNo!\n\nSheldon (over radio):\n\nRed leader to red five.\n\nRed leader to red five.\n\nAnybody up for a little game?\n\nI spy with my little eye...\n\nA nonferrous metal.\n\nMust be out of range.\n\nLeonard, can I ask you a question?\n\nSure.\n\nAre you bothered by the fact that your former girlfriend\n\nLeft the symposium with what is probably\n\nThe most beautiful man\n\nI've ever seen in my life?\n\nNo. Why do you ask?\n\nBecause we're going\n\nAll right, if no one's going to guess...\n\nI was spying the aluminum rims on the police car\n\nWe passed a few miles back.\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "b5467f0b-7669-4fd6-9c36-67b2984da47e": {"__data__": {"id_": "b5467f0b-7669-4fd6-9c36-67b2984da47e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "ad54bdeab5e4ca38fa12c629400ef75afd8e9915a715e1a7b89b672f8d427f06", "text": "  \ufeff1\n\nGood evening.\n\nI'm your guest lecturer,\n\nDr. Sheldon Cooper.\n\nI was expecting applause, but I suppose stunned silence is equally appropriate.\n\nI agreed to speak to you this evening, because I was told that you're the best and the brightest of this university's doctoral candidates.\n\nHmm. Of course, that's like saying you are the most important electron in a hydrogen atom. 'Cause, you see, there's only one electron in a hydrogen atom.\n\nBest and brightest, my sweet patootie.\n\nAll right, let's begin.\n\nShow of hands, who here is familiar with the concept of topological insulators?\n\nDon't kid yourselves.\n\nI found another tweet from a student at Sheldon's lecture. \"Dr. Cooper has taken a relatively boring subject \"and managed to make it completely insufferable.\n\nPlus, he looks like a giant insect.\"\n\nLook. Listen to this one. \"Does Einstein's theory explain why time flies \"when you're having fun, \"but when you're listening to Dr. Cooper, it falls out of the sky, dead?\"\n\nOoh, somebody took pictures and uploaded them to their Flickr account.\n\nWow.\n\nHow do you get an entire lecture hall to flip you off at the same time?\n\nApparently, if you're Sheldon, all you need to do is turn your back.\n\nHey, Leonard, is your wi-fi down?\n\nI can't get on.\n\nOh, Sheldon changed the password.\n\nIt's now \"Penny is a freeloader.\"\n\nNo spaces.\n\nThanks.\n\nWhat are you guys doing?\n\nSheldon gave a lecture at the university tonight.\n\nWe're reading the reviews.\n\nOh. How'd he do?\n\nWell, picture the Hindenburg meets Chernobyl meets Three Mile Island meets <i>Tron 2.</i>\n\nThat bad, huh?\n\nRead this woman's tweet. \"Listening to Dr. Cooper has made me want to start cutting myself again\"\"\n\nYeah.\n\nGood evening,\n\nLeonard, Howard, Raj, freeloader.\n\nSo, how'd the lecture go?\n\nIn a word, triumphant.\n\nReally? Triumphant?\n\nOh, yes, you should have seen those young people.\n\nThirsty for knowledge, drinking in my wisdom.\n\nI may have changed a few lives today.\n\nOh, please let me tell him.\n\nI don't know,\n\nI kind of promised Howard.\n\nTell me what?\n\nActually, we should all share the moment.\n\nRaj, if you would.\n\nOh, tweets about my lecture.\n\nHmm...\n\nThat's rather unfair.\n\nThat's downright cruel.\n\nPlus, insects have six legs.\n\nYeah, I'm not familiar with the acronym \"KMN\"\"\n\nFrom the context, we think it means \"kill me now.\"\n\nWell, I suppose everyone's entitled to their own opinion.\n\nI think I'll turn in.\n\nI didn't want to teach those poopy heads, anyway.\n\nFYI, I think that's what Darth Vader said just before he started building the Death Star. \u266a Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \u266a \u266a Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \u266a \u266a The Earth began to cool \u266a \u266a The autotrophs began to drool,\n\nNeanderthals developed tools \u266a \u266a We built the Wall \u266a \u266a <i>We built the pyramids</i> \u266a \u266a Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \u266a \u266a That all started with a big bang \u266a \u266a <i>Bang!</i> \u266a\n\nOriginal Air Date on February 3, 2011 == Sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> == == for <font color=#00FFFF>www.addic7ed.com</font> ==\n\nSheldon still moping?\n\nYeah, it's weird.\n\nEven though he didn't want to give the lecture in the first place, being rejected by those students really hit him hard.\n\nI know the feeling.\n\nIt's like accidentally walking into a gay bar and then having no one hit on you.\n\nIt-It happened to a friend of mine.\n\nAre you guys doing okay?\n\nLeonard and I are fine, but I think Raj needs to meet a girl really soon.\n\nWell, that shouldn't be too hard.\n\nHe's such a cutie.\n\nThank you, but \"cute\" is for bunnies.\n\nI want to be something with sex appeal, like... like a labradoodle.\n\nLabradoodle?\n\nWe might be starting to zero in on your problem.\n\nDon't you listen to them.\n\nYou've got plenty of sex appeal.\n\nYou really think so?\n\nYeah. You're a hottie.\n\nWell, thanks, Bernadette.\n\nAnd just for the record, labradoodles are hypo-allergenic, which is a very sexy quality to those troubled by animal dander.\n\nAMY\n\nSo, what do you think?\n\nIt's a charming illusion, but it does not cheer me up.\n\nNot even when I do this?\n\nNo.\n\nWell, that was the last arrow in my quiver of whimsy.\n\nDo you realize that teaching is the first thing\n\nI've failed at since my ill-fated attempt to complete a chin-up in March of 1989?\n\nIf this humiliating experience is really troubling you, there are things we could do about it.\n\nFor instance?\n\nWell, the first thing that comes to mind is isolating the part of your brain where the memory is stored and destroying it with a laser.\n\nHmm, no.\n\nOne slip of the hand, and suddenly I'm sitting in the Engineering Department, building doodads with Wolowitz.\n\nAll right.\n\nHave you considered improving your socialization skills, thus allowing you to communicate more effectively with other people?\n\nIsn't that their burden?\n\nI'm the one with something interesting to say.\n\nFair enough, but in its essence, teaching is a performance art.\n\nIn the classroom paradigm, the teacher has the responsibility to communicate, as well as entertain and engage.\n\nI sense that you're trying to slow-walk me to an epiphany.\n\nWould you mind very much jumping to it?\n\nPerhaps you should consider taking acting lessons.\n\nActing lessons.\n\nInteresting.\n\nIt might help if I could act as though I care about my students and whether or not they learn.\n\nPenny.\n\nPenny. Penny.\n\nWhat?\n\nYou're an \"actress,\" correct?\n\nI'm not an \"actress.\"\n\nI'm an actress.\n\nAll right.\n\nYou're an actress.\n\nI need you to teach me.\n\nYou want an acting lesson?\n\nPerhaps two. I'd like to master the craft.\n\nOkay, where is this coming from?\n\nIt has been suggested to me that acting techniques could improve my lecturing, at which, if certain tweets and blogs are to be believed,\n\nI \"suck the big one.\"\n\nYeah, I saw those.\n\nThey were funny.\n\nI printed a few out and put 'em on my fridge.\n\nSo, when could we start?\n\nOkay, just to be clear.\n\nYou are asking me for help because I know something that the brilliant\n\nDr. Sheldon Cooper doesn't.\n\nI suppose that's one way to look at it.\n\nI think it's the only way to look at it.\n\nAre you going to help me or not?\n\nProbably. I'm just enjoying the foreplay.\n\nDoes this mean you are done mocking my acting career?\n\nOh, I'm sorry, I thought making the transition from actor to acting teacher was the signal that one's career had reached the end of the road.\n\nForget it.\n\nI'll pay you $40.\n\nSaturday, 9:00 a.m.\n\nBring cash.\n\nRaj, I have amazing news!\n\nWhat?\n\nI just got offered a fellowship at the Weitzmann\n\nInstitute in Israel.\n\nDude, that's incredible!\n\nI know.\n\nThe only thing is, I'm gonna be gone for two years.\n\nAw, I'm gonna miss you.\n\nAre you going with him?\n\nI have to stay here for school.\n\nThat's what we're here to talk to you about.\n\nYou see,\n\nBernadette has needs.\n\nWhat kind of needs?\n\nSexual needs.\n\nMost of them regular, some of them kind of messed up.\n\nSo, while I'm gone, you're going to have to satisfy her.\n\nWhat do you say?\n\nI say okey-dokey.\n\nWhat ya thinking so hard about?\n\nJust that\n\nI'm definitely not gay.\n\nSHELDON\n\nPenny!\n\nPenny! Penny!\n\nWhat's wrong?\n\nNothing.\n\nI was acting.\n\nYou were acting.\n\nYes. In preparation for today's studies,\n\nI read Stanislavski's\n\nStella Adler's\n\nUta Hagen's and Henry Winkler's\n\nWell, good for you.\n\nCome on in.\n\nHow shall we begin?\n\nWell, I thought we'd start with some basic movement exercises.\n\nYou know, get our bodies warmed up a little.\n\nAll right.\n\nSo I just want you to relax and kind of move around in the space.\n\nYou know, just do whatever feels natural.\n\nSheldon?\n\nYou said to do whatever feels natural.\n\nThis feels natural.\n\nCertainly more natural than what you're doing.\n\nCome on, you got to work with me.\n\nWe need to get connected with our bodies.\n\nPenny, my body and I have a relationship that works best when we maintain a cool, wary distance from each other.\n\nAll right, let's just say we've warmed up.\n\nYou're the \"teacher.\"\n\nOkay. One of the things that might help you in connecting with your students is being a little more spontaneous.\n\nSo why don't we try some improvisation?\n\nWhy not?\n\nIt seems like you're improvising your entire curriculum.\n\nThis is all about listening and responding.\n\nGotcha.\n\nI'm going to create a character and a situation, and you just jump in when you feel it.\n\nAll right.\n\nAll right.\n\nAction.\n\nOkay, it's not a movie.\n\nIt's improv.\n\nSo no one calls \"action.\"\n\nHey, you taught me something.\n\nWho would have thought it?\n\nOkay.\n\nUh, no, the shipment has not arrived, and I really need those shoes.\n\nThey are my biggest seller.\n\nYes, ladies sizes six through ten.\n\nThank you.\n\nOh, sorry.\n\nI have to go.\n\nI have a customer. Bye-bye.\n\nHi. Can I help you?\n\nI'd like a frozen yogurt, please.\n\nYogurt?\n\nYeah.\n\nUm...\n\nOkay, sure.\n\nLuckily, we sell both shoes and yogurt here.\n\nYou do?\n\nYes. Look up at the sign, and remember, improv is always about saying yes.\n\nAll right.\n\nYes.\n\nI see a sign.\n\nIt says \"Camarillo State\n\nMental Hospital.\"\n\nWhat?\n\nIt's the only explanation\n\nI can come up with for why you think you sell shoes and yogurt.\n\nOkay, you know what?\n\nLet's just try a different improv. Uh..\n\nOh, this time we will be two winos living under a freeway overpass.\n\nOh, and we're going to use props?\n\nYou bet.\n\nI had dreams, you know.\n\nI was gonna be famous.\n\nShow everybody back home\n\nI could be someone.\n\nNow look at me.\n\nWant some?\n\nYou have any frozen yogurt?\n\nI'm still not adjusted to how the SyFy channel spells their name now.\n\nS-y-F-y.\n\nThat's \"siffy.\"\n\nUh-huh.\n\nHello?\n\nOh, my God! Is he okay?\n\nWhat happened?\n\nHang on. Hang on.\n\nUh-huh.\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nHoward was on his scooter, and got hit by a truck.\n\nHe's in critical condition.\n\nOh, no!\n\nDid you hear?\n\nIsn't it terrible?\n\nHave you seen him?\n\nThey wouldn't let me in.\n\nOh, my Howie.\n\nIt'll be okay.\n\nIt'll be okay.\n\nIt'll be okay.\n\nIt'll be okay.\n\nIt's Howard.\n\nHoward, hello.\n\nRaj, is that you?\n\nYeah, I'm right here, buddy. How are you?\n\nShh, shh.

Take care.\n\nI guess I have no choice but to make sweet, guilt-free love to you over and over again for the rest of my life.\n\nThat's how I heard it.\n\nOr it could be \"sy-fee.\"\n\nWhat?\n\nS-y-F-y. \"Sy-fee.\"\n\nOh, right.\n\nGood one.\n\nSo, did you get a chance to go over the scene I gave you?\n\nYes. I didn't care for it.\n\nOkay, <i>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</i> is an American classic.\n\nSo is the McRib sandwich.\n\nI don't care for that, either.\n\nFine. What would you rather do as a scene study?\n\nI'm glad you asked.\n\nI took the liberty of adapting a <i>Star Trek</i> fan fiction novella\n\nI wrote when I was ten into a one-act play.\n\nAnd you think it's better than Tennessee Williams?\n\nWhy don't we leave that for future generations to decide?\n\nIt's the story of a young boy who is transported from the ignorant backwoods of East Texas to the 23rd Century, where his genius is not only appreciated, but celebrated.\n\nKMN...\n\nNow, in this pivotal scene,\n\nSheldon's mother, played by you, argues with an emissary of the United Federation of Planets, Mr. Spock, the role I will bring to life.\n\nOkay, that's fine, but let's try and get you out of your comfort zone.\n\nWhy would we want to do that?\n\nIt's called \"the comfort zone\" for a reason.\n\nOkay, the whole point of this is to loosen you up a little, so I'm thinking you'll play the role of your mother, and I will bring life to Mr. Spock.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nYou'll be Spock?\n\nIt's only logical.\n\nVery well.\n\nI'll set the scene.\n\nAll right. \"East Texas. \"A warm summer night. \"A woman, Mary, \"stands on a porch.\n\nIn the distance, we hear a lonesome train whistle...\" \"The droning buzz of cicadas..\"\" \"A coyote howls at the moon, frightening sensitive young boys everywhere.\" \"Out in the woods, an owl screeches...\"\n\nOkay, okay.\n\nWe get it.\n\nYou set the scene.\n\nHoo!\n\nNow just read your mother's line. \"Shelly! \"Shelly, how many times have I told you \"not to leave your sciencey stuff out on the porch? \"Goodness, \"I'll never understand that boy. \"But then again,\n\nI'm a religious nut, and my mind is closed to so many things.\" \"Spock to <i>Enterprise.</i>\n\nTransport successful.\" \"Glory be to Heaven, \"some sort of creature just manifested out of thin air. \"George, put down that Pepsi can full of bourbon that ain't foolin' no one, and get your shotgun!\" \"Greetings, Mary Cooper.\n\nI am Spock.\"\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nI just don't buy it.\n\nJust keep going! \"Oh, my, your sudden appearance startles me.\" \"We have been monitoring your son Sheldon \"from the 23rd Century, and \"we have determined that he is now ready \"to join us. \"His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy.\" \"I understand. \"Oh, Shelly? \"A man's here to take you away to the future!\n\nBe sure to pack clean underwear.\"\n\nOkay, okay, let's try that last line again, and this time, maybe try choking up a little.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, you're losing your son.\n\nYes, but he's going to a better place where he won't get beat up... so much.\n\nAll right, come on, just try it my way.\n\nPretend you're sad to see him go.\n\nI'm gonna lead you in. \"His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy.\"\n\nThat's your cue.\n\nI'm sorry.

'Cause you're succeeding.\n\nWell, then prepare to be terrified.\n\nIf your friends are unconvincing, this year's donations might go to, say, the geology department.\n\nOh, dear, the dirt people!\n\nOr worse-- it could go to... the liberal arts.\n\nNo!\n\nMillions of dollars being showered on poets, literary theorists and students of gender studies.\n\nOh, the humanities!\n\nOn the bright side, I don't think President Siebert will be making us go to any more fund-raisers.\n\nIt was so much easier at my bar mitzvah.\n\nThe old people just came up to you, pinched your cheek and handed you a savings bond.\n\nOh, don't be such gloomy Gusses.\n\nLook at the size of these shrimp!\n\nAt what point do we start calling them lobsters?\n\nFace it, Raj, we crashed and burned tonight.\n\nOh, you didn't do that badly.\n\nMrs. Latham, the first machine\n\nI turn on in the morning is the helium-neon laser, 'cause it needs to warm up.\n\nI no longer care, dear.\n\nBut don't worry,\n\nI really enjoyed meeting you this evening. u're kidding.\n\nThat was good for you? 'Cause I was sweating through my T-shirt.\n\nExcellent! There's nothing I like better than making smart people feel ill at ease.\n\nWhy?\n\nOh, I don't know, it's one of the fun things you get to do when you have lots of money.\n\nWatch.\n\nHey! Who said you could eat that shrimp?\n\nSee? Fun.\n\nNo, no, no, I'm just here for your money.\n\nI don't want to shake anyone's germy hands.\n\nExplain it to them, Siebert.\n\nI must confess\n\nI don't understand you,\n\nPresident Siebert.\n\nFirst you say you want me to appear at your fund-raisers, but now you say you never want me to go anywhere near your fund-raisers.\n\nForgive me, but that sounds like a mixed message.\n\nHere we go again.\n\nIf there's simply no talking to me, why did you call?\n\nI'm sorry, someone's on the other line.\n\nWhy don't you see if you can organize your thoughts, and we'll try again later.\n\nCooper-Hofstadter residence.\n\nGo for Cooper.\n\nGood morning, Mrs. Latham.\n\nWell, yes, of course\n\nI remember you.\n\nA woman well past her prime seeking to augment her social status by doling out her late husband's ill-gotten gains.\n\nSo, how much money are you going to give me?\n\nI'm not crazy-- my mother had me tested.\n\nWell, if you're not going to give me money, then why are you calling?\n\nShe wants to talk to you.\n\nWho's crazy now?\n\nHello, Mrs. Latham.\n\nYes, I live with him.\n\nI don't...\n\nI-I really don't know why.\n\nTonight? Sure, that'd be great.\n\nOkay, I'll see you then.\n\nBye.\n\nShe wants to have dinner and talk about my research.\n\nAn entire dinner to talk about your research?\n\nWhere you going, the drive-thru at Jack in the Box?\n\nWell, wherever we're going, she's sending a car to pick me up.\n\nOkay,\n\nI see what's happening.\n\nWhat?\n\nMy stature intimidates her, so she's using you to get to me.\n\nCrafty old gal.\n\nExcuse me, but you are not the only distinguished scientist in this apartment.\n\nI've been published in peer-reviewed journals,\n\nI received a Dissertation of the Year award for experimental particle physics.\n\nNo, that can't be it.\n\nAnd since you seem to have forgotten, the reason we live together is we're best friends.\n\nAnd I got your back, Jack.\n\nThat was a great meal.\n\nI'm glad you enjoyed it.\n\nThe only time I eat this well is when my mom's in town and she takes me out to dinner.\n\nIs that so?\n\nYou kind of remind me of her.\n\nShe enjoys making people uncomfortable, too.\n\nWell, you remind me of a boy I dated in college.\n\nNo kidding.\n\nSweet boy.\n\nVery smart.\n\nIf only he'd had money.\n\nYeah, um... so, hey, speaking of money, how are you feeling about helping the physics department get a cryogenic centrifugal pump and molecular sieve?\n\nWell, I must say, you make a very persuasive case for it.\n\nOh, good, good.\n\nAnd I'm seriously considering taking it to the next level.\n\nTerrific. Great.\n\nWhat level is that?\n\nOkay, now you don't remind me of my mom.\n\nI'm sorry, so, eventually, zombies are going to attack the rehab facility where Sandra Bullock is?\n\nYes, Sheldon. Keep watching.\n\nYou know, it's a shame, all that work she's doing to get sober, only to be torn apart and eaten alive.\n\nHey. How was dinner?\n\nSwell. I need a drink.\n\nDo we have any alcohol?\n\nNo. But we have potatoes--\n\nI could make you vodka.\n\nIt'll take two weeks.\n\nLeonard, are you okay?\n\nUm, I'm not sure.\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nWell, Mrs. Latham said she was seriously considering donating money so we could get a cryogenic centrifugal pump...\n\nYes!\n\nOh, wow! ...then she stuck her tongue down my throat.\n\nWhy?\n\nOkay, we can't keep explaining everything.\n\nRead that book we got you.\n\nShe hit on me.\n\nWait-wait-wait.\n\nAre you telling us that old lady wanted to have sex with you in exchange for giving your department millions of dollars?\n\nI think so.\n\nYou lucky duck.\n\nYou're really a broken toy, aren't you?\n\nI was able to get out of there before anything else happened, but she wants to see me again tomorrow night.\n\nExcellent!\n\nWhat are you planning to wear?\n\nWhat?\n\nPenny, you're an expert on trading sexual favors for material gain-- walk him through this.\n\nWell, n-no, hold on a second,\n\nI'm not going to sleep with her.\n\nBut we need a cryogenic centrifugal pump.\n\nWell, forget it!\n\nIt's not gonna happen.\n\nWell, come now, Leonard, this may be your only chance to make a real contribution to science!\n\nI repeat: Not gonna happen.\n\nWhat was all that about me trading sexual favors for material gain?\n\nIt was a compliment.\n\nI believe in giving credit where credit is due.\n\nOkay, fine. I'll tell him.\n\nLeonard, Mrs. Latham's car is here for you.\n\nI won't be too late;\n\nI'm just gonna make a final pitch for the funding and then say good night.\n\nHold on,\n\nI have something for you.\n\nWhat's this?\n\nJust a few things you may need tonight.\n\nBaby oil, condoms and, uh... a little something I procured from the school of pharmacology.\n\nThey say it is to Viagra as\n\nViagra is to a green M&M.\n\nI am not going to have sex with her.\n\nMaybe this will overcome your reluctance.\n\nI went on the Internet and found a photograph of a 25-year-old Mrs. Latham to get your libido humming.\n\nCheck out those saddle shoes.\n\nAre you insane?\n\nI'm not going to prostitute myself just so we can get some new equipment.\n\nOh, come on! Why not?\n\nGood night,\n\nSheldon.\n\nGiven how much time you spend engaging in pointless self-abuse, you might consider, just this once, using your genitalia to actually accomplish something!\n\nHe still won't shag the old lady, huh?\n\nNo. But thank you for asking.\n\nHey. Hi.\n\nHello, Leonard.\n\nI hope you're hungry.\n\nI'm very hungry.\n\nFor food, right?\n\nOh, I made you uncomfortable last night.\n\nI'm so sorry.\n\nNo, that's okay.\n\nNo, it most certainly is not.\n\nLeonard, I'm making the donation to your department regardless of what happens between us.\n\nReally?\n\nWell, of course.\n\nThere's no quid pro quo here.\n\nYou and your colleagues are doing remarkable research, and you deserve the money.\n\nOh.\n\nThen what was last night about?\n\nI took a shot; sue me.\n\nOh.\n\nYou're a very handsome man, Leonard.\n\nThank you.\n\nIt was foolish of me to think someone your age might ever be interested in someone like me.\n\nOh, don't say that.\n\nYou're a very attractive woman.\n\nOh, please.\n\nNo, it's true.\n\nWell, aren't you sweet.\n\nJust for the record... you'd remember a night with me for the rest of your life.\n\nI'm sure I would.\n\nBut why-why, exactly?\n\nYou're a very smart man.\n\nHow do you think I landed such a rich husband?\n\nI hadn't really given it much thought.\n\nWell, think about it.\n\nDo you mean...?\n\nYep. I'm that good.\n\nOh, what the hell.\n\nGood morning, slut.\n\nWhat?\n\nOh, please, I recognize the walk of shame when I see it.\n\nAll you're missing is a little smeared mascara and a purse with panties wadded up in it.\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nOh, nothing's going on.\n\nExcuse me.\n\nAre you just getting home?\n\nYeah.\n\nThat's a good sign, right?\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nI'm so proud of you!\n\nYou sold yourself out like a common streetwalker!\n\nNo, I didn't do it for the money.\n\nShe stiffed you?\n\nI believe that's what your roommate did to her.\n\nWhat?!\n\nAgain, read the book we gave you.\n\nNo, I mean,\n\nI-I got the money first.\n\nSmart.

Then perhaps you don't understand what's going on.\n\nYour former boyfriend has replaced you with what appears to be a very suitable mate.\n\nArguably much more suitable than you.\n\nOh. Well, good for him.\n\nHey, what do you mean, \"more suitable\"?\n\nWell, granted, Penny, your secondary sexual characteristics are reasonably bodacious.\n\nBut Priya is highly educated, she's an accomplished professional, and she comes from the culture that literally wrote the book on neat ways to have sex.\n\nWhereas you, on the other hand, are a community college dropout who comes from the culture that wrote the book on tipping cows.\n\nYeah. Okay, I got it.\n\nI got it.\n\nSo... what is all that stuff?\n\nThis is a portable electroencephalogram.\n\nI'm doing research on emotions and brain activity.\n\nSo when you start crying,\n\nI can see which region of the brain is activated.\n\nThen I'm going to stimulate the analogous area in the brain of a rhesus monkey and see if he cries.\n\nCool, huh?\n\nI choose you.\n\nReally?\n\nYep. I moved out of my mother's house.\n\nCord is cut.\n\nI'm all yours.\n\nWhat did she say when you told her?\n\nI don't know. She hasn't responded to my email yet.\n\nThis is so great.\n\nI love you, Howard.\n\nI love you, too.\n\nSo what's for dinner?\n\nWell, I don't really have much of anything in the house.\n\nThat's fine.\n\nWhy don't we go fool around in our bedroom?\n\nAnd then you can go shopping.\n\nI thought maybe after we eat, we could see an early movie.\n\nI'd love that.\n\nI love the way you say, \"I'd love that.\"\n\nShe says it the same way I do. \"I'd love that.\"\n\nEverybody in India says it that way.\n\nIt's not a big deal.\n\nRajesh, don't be a child.\n\nI'm not being a child.\n\nLeonard, I swear to God, if your sister ever comes to town,\n\nI shall have my way with her.\n\nMy sister's 38 and married.\n\nAll the more shame that will fall upon the house of Hofstadter.\n\nOoh, I thought I smelled pizza.\n\nThat's remarkable.\n\nIf pepperoni were an explosive substance, you could replace\n\nGerman shepherds at our nation's airports.\n\nHi. Penny, right?\n\nOh, yes. H-Hi. I'm sorry.\n\nI didn't know you had company.\n\nI don't want to impose.\n\nNo, no. It's not an imposition.\n\nAt this point, in our ecosystem, you are akin to the plover, a small scavenging bird that eats extra food from between the teeth of crocodiles.\n\nPlease, fly into our open maw, and have at it.\n\nIf I had more than a box of baking soda in my refrigerator,\n\nI wouldn't have to take that.\n\nHi, bestie.\n\nHi.\n\nSo, um, Priya, you're a lawyer, right?\n\nI know. Pretty boring, huh?\n\nOh, come on.\n\nIt's not boring at all.\n\nShe's currently helping set up a secondary derivative market which would allow overseas car firms to hedge their investments against potential advancements in battery technology.\n\nHmm?\n\nThank you, Leonard.\n\nThat doesn't make it sound boring at all.\n\nSo, how you holding up?\n\nI'm fine.\n\nOh, who are you kidding?\n\nShe's breathtaking.\n\nSo, Penny,\n\nLeonard tells me you're an actress.\n\nThat must be pretty exciting.\n\nOh, yeah, yeah.\n\nIt's real great.\n\nToday I drove to Van Nuys for an audition\n\nI thought was going to be for a cat food commercial.\n\nTurned out to be porn.\n\nDid you get the part?\n\nI didn't do the audition.\n\nGiven the state of your career, can you really afford to be picky?\n\nI took acting classes when I was at Cambridge.\n\nI loved it.\n\nWe did <i>Taming</i>\n\nOh, wow. I love\n\nTaming of the Shrew.\n\nI did a paper on it in high school. \"Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting?\n\nIn his tail.\" \"In his tongue\"\" \"Whose tongue?\" \"Yours, if you talk of tails, and so farewell.\" \"What, with my tongue in your tail?\"\n\nI'm regretting my earlier cattiness.\n\nShe is an absolute delight.\n\nWow.\n\nWow, indeed.\n\nI can't believe we're finally living together.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou know what would make this moment perfect?\n\nWhat?\n\nA little snack.\n\nYou got any string cheese?\n\nNo.\n\nI-I might have some cheddar.\n\nNot as good.\n\nYou can't make strings with it.\n\nRemind me to put it on your shopping list.\n\nOkay.\n\nYou have hypo-allergenic detergent?\n\nNo.\n\nBetter put it on the list.\n\nIf you wash my underwear with regular soap,\n\nI get little red bumps on my <i>tuchus.</i>\n\nWait a second.\n\nI'm doing your laundry?\n\nWell, honey, it's not gonna do itself.\n\nOh, before I forget, tomorrow morning, you're driving me to the dentist.\n\nI have to take you?\n\nYou don't have to take me.\n\nYou get to take me.\n\nWait a minute.\n\nAre you telling me your mother usually takes you to the dentist?\n\nIt's not weird.\n\nThere's lots of kids there with their moms.\n\nI can't believe this.\n\nWhat? It's fun.\n\nIf I have no cavities, afterwards, we go out for a treat.\n\nAll right, Howard, let's get something straight right now.\n\nI'm not going to be your mother.\n\nWhoa, whoa, whoa!\n\nWhere did that come from?\n\nMRS.

Good night.\n\nLeonard.\n\nYeah?\n\nWe had a good run, you and I.\n\nOkay.\n\nBut change is a part of life.\n\nIt certainly is.\n\nOkay.\n\nI have guests coming.\n\nI'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave now.\n\nI am leaving.\n\nDon't make this harder than it is, Leonard.\n\nGood-bye, Sheldon.\n\nAnd good-bye to you, sir.\n\nHe'll be back.\n\nOf course I'll be back.\n\nI live here!\n\nWell, it would appear\n\nLeVar Burton won't be joining us.\n\nLet's get started.\n\nI thought we'd begin by going around the room, introducing ourselves and saying a little bit about why we're here.\n\nOkay.\n\nI'm Sheldon.\n\nUh, for regular readers of <i>The New England Journal</i>\n\nI need no introduction.\n\nIf you're not familiar with that publication, there's a free copy in your goody bag.\n\nStuart?\n\nUm... Hi.\n\nI'm Stuart.\n\nI run a comic bookstore, which for financial reasons,\n\nI'm currently living in.\n\nAnd I guess what I'm hoping for most out of tonight is a hot shower.\n\nIt's very nice, Stuart.\n\nZack?\n\nI'm Zack, and I'm, uh...\n\nUh...\n\nCould you come back to me?\n\nOf course.\n\nBarry?\n\nI'm Barry Kwipke, and I'm here because you told me there was going to be a whaffle.\n\nWhen is the whaffle?\n\nPatience, patience, Barry.\n\nThe whaffle...\n\nThe <i>raffle</i> is the grand finale to an evening-long festival of fun and folly.\n\nOne more question...\n\nYes, you must be present to win.\n\nOkay, I'm ready.\n\nI'm Zach, and I'm, uh...\n\nOh, crap, why is this so hard?\n\nOh, hey.\n\nHi.\n\nYo, P-dog.\n\nWhat's up?\n\nWe're here to kidnap you for a girls' night out. the term \"kidnap\" is being used playfully.\n\nI kind of figured that.\n\nGood. Now put this pillowcase over your head.\n\nNo.\n\nShe used to be much more fun, until Leonard punched her in the heart.\n\nWe just thought you might want to go out and have a good time, maybe go dancing.\n\nOh. Gee, thanks, but I'm not really in the mood.\n\nYou do understand that it will distract you from obsessing over the rich variety of sweet loving that your ex-boyfriend is currently receiving from the fiery jewel of Mumbai.\n\nOkay, look, if I agree to go out with you guys, will you promise to stop pestering me about Leonard and Priya?\n\nYes.\n\nSure.\n\nAll right. I'll go change.\n\nCome on in.\n\nIf you'd have let me bring the chloroform, we wouldn't have had to put up with all this jibber-jabber.\n\nAnyway, after we get done snowboarding,\n\nI go back to the lodge and get in the Jacuzzi.\n\nThere's no one around, so naturally, I'm free-balling it.\n\nNext thing I know, this beautiful chick shows up, drunk out of her skull, wants to get in with me.\n\nQuestion.\n\nWas it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub?\n\nReally? That's your question?\n\nWhat's the difference? \"Jacuzzi\" is a commercial brand. \"Hot tub\" is the generic term.\n\nI.E., all Jacuzzis are hot tubs, but not all hot tubs are Jacuzzis.\n\nIs that like all thumbs are fingers, but not all fingers are thumbs?\n\nSurprisingly, yes.\n\nNice.\n\nNow, what exactly are toes?\n\nCan you please get back to the drunk girl?\n\nI'd like something to think about in the shower.\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nRight. Anyway, she takes off all of her clothes, climbs into the hot tub, and the first thing I notice...\n\nThe water level rose.\n\nNo.\n\nOf course it did.\n\nIt's said that Archimedes, the ancient Greek mathematician, discovered the principle of displacement while taking a bath.\n\nTerrific.\n\nGo ahead, Zack.\n\nNaked drunk girl, free-balling, continue.\n\nForgive me, but I think you'll find my story is more interesting.\n\nDoes yours have wet breasts in it?\n\nBetter.\n\nIt has a gold crown.\n\nYou see, the king wondered how much gold was in it and charged Archimedes with coming up with the solution.\n\nBecause the crown was irregularly shaped, there was no way to mathematically determine its volume.\n\nBut, while bathing,\n\nArchimedes realized he could immerse the crown and measure the amount the water rose.\n\nSo, long story short,\n\nI nailed her.\n\nWhen he finished, he shouted \"Eureka!\"\n\nNo, I always shout, \"Holy moly!\"\n\nDon't know why.\n\nJust do.\n\nAll right, that concludes the \"getting to know you\" portion of the evening.\n\nWho's ready to play some vintage video games?\n\nAnd tonight's selections include\n\nColecoVision's \"Smurf Rescue in Gargamel's Castle,\"\n\nAtari's \"Cookie Monster Munch,\" and for you text adventure aficionados, \"Zork.\"\n\nPick me, pick me. I'm fun.\n\nThat all sucks the big hairy meatball.\n\nHow about I go get the karaoke machine out of my car, get plastered and blow the roof off this place?\n\nGreat, I'll make a beer run.\n\nAnd I'll take a shower.\n\nWe'll meet back here in 15.\n\nCheck.\n\nI'm unhappy.\n\nThis is delicious.\n\nWhere'd you learn to make chili?\n\nWhen I was at university in England, my flatmate was from Texas.\n\nI hope she wasn't anything like my flatmate from Texas.\n\nSheldon is a bit quirky, isn't he?\n\nOh, please.\n\nThat crazy bastard's looking at quirky in the rearview mirror.\n\nDid you know that, per our roommate agreement,\n\nI have to wash my feet before I get in the shower?\n\nAnd not in the sink.\n\nWe each have special buckets.\n\nRaj, did you ever tell your sister about the time Sheldon got punched by Bill Gates?\n\nOh, God, you're kidding.\n\nNope.\n\nGates gave a speech at the university.\n\nSheldon went up to him afterwards and said, \"Maybe if you weren't so distracted by sick children in Africa, you could have put a little more thought into Windows Vista.\"\n\nBam. Right in the nose.\n\nMade me proud to own a PC.\n\nI'd like to propose a toast to a rare and wonderful\n\nSheldon-free evening.\n\nHear, hear.\n\nCheers.\n\nYou realize that's the first time we've ever done that without having to listen to Sheldon tell us why it's called a toast?\n\nWhy is it called a toast?\n\nOh, the ancient Romans put spiced toast in their punch bowls.\n\nSheldon tells it better.\n\nHe kind of does.\n\nYeah.\n\nAw, hell, I miss him.\n\nSo, where do you guys want to go dancing?\n\nWe were hoping you'd know a place.\n\nYes, perhaps somewhere packed tightly with young, beautiful bodies sweating and writhing against each other in a glorious orgy of the flesh.\n\nOh, yeah, I know that place.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nThat should display enough of your bosom to attract a new mate, or a hungry infant.\n\nOkay, let's go through this one more time.\n\nJust because\n\nLeonard has a new girlfriend does not mean I need to go out and hook up with some guy.\n\nBut you could if you wanted to, right?\n\nWell, yeah, I guess.\n\nPick out the hottest guy in the room, take him home, do unspeakable things to him, then kick him to the curb with a smile on his face and teeth marks on his heinie?\n\nMore or less.\n\nWhat's that like?\n\nI don't know.\n\nIt's fun while you're doing it.\n\nAnd then after, it's mostly embarrassment, self-loathing and regret.\n\nI would take that deal all day long.\n\nYeah, well, it's not gonna happen tonight.\n\nYou know, for the first time in my life,\n\nI am not in a relationship, and I'm totally okay with it.\n\nYou know, if being on your own is new to you,\n\nI'd be happy to share some tension-relieving techniques for ladies I've perfected over the years.\n\nFor example, do you have an electric toothbrush?\n\nUm, no.\n\nYou should get one.\n\nWhat's that?\n\nIt appears to be something preserved between two pieces of acrylic.\n\nOh, it's a snowflake from the North Pole.\n\nLeonard gave it to me last year.\n\nOh, God, that is so romantic.\n\nYeah, it was.\n\nLeonard's really one of a kind.\n\nSaying that while holding a snowflake is a bit heavy-handed, don't you think?\n\nLet me see that.\n\nOh, screw it.\n\nI can deal with a little self-loathing.\n\nLet's go find me a heinie to bite.\n\nOutstanding.\n\nAnd if we fail, we can always stop at CVS and pick you out a nice toothbrush.\n\nI call mine \"Gerard.\"\n\nThat's kind of creepy. \u266a Don't go breaking my heart \u266a \u266a I couldn't if I tried \u266a \u266a Oh, honey, if I get restless \u266a \u266a Baby, you're not that kind \u266a \u266a Don't go breaking my heart \u266a\n\nAnybody do \"Walking on Sunshine\" yet?\n\nNo.\n\nDibs.\n\nI'm sorry, Sheldon bought a loom and learned how to weave?\n\nHe actually got pretty good.\n\nHe made us all matching serapes.\n\nI still wear mine when there's a nip in the air.\n\nNow, was this before or after he adopted the 25 cats?\n\nLong before the cats.\n\nI think it was around the time he tried to declare our apartment a sovereign nation.\n\nI still have some of the currency.\n\nAll my friends.\n\nAll my friends.\n\nAll my friends.\n\nI think it's like Beetlejuice.\n\nWe said his name too many times.\n\nCome on in.\n\nThank you.\n\nHey. I thought you were with your new buddies.\n\nI had to leave.\n\nThey were having fun wrong.\n\nCome here, Sheldon.\n\nSit here with me.\n\nThank you.\n\nWould you like some homemade chili?\n\nAre there beans in it?\n\nYes.\n\nThen it's not chili.\n\nReal chili has no beans in it, but you're from a foreign land, so your ignorance is forgiven.\n\nSheldon, do you want some or not?\n\nYes, please.\n\nYour girlfriend's a little short-tempered.\n\nI'd like to propose a toast to friends, no matter how quirky.\n\nCheers.\n\nPriya, do you know why this is called a toast?\n\nActually, I do.\n\nI believe the Romans used to put spiced toast in their punch bowls.\n\nShe's also a bit of a know-it-all.\n\nMmm. This is good.\n\nWhatever it is. \u266a I'm walking on sunshine \u266a \u266a <i>Whoa</i> \u266a \u266a <i>Whoa</i> \u266a \u266a I'm walking on sunshine \u266a \u266a <i>Whoa</i> \u266a \u266a <i>Whoa</i> \u266a\n\nHello?

Get another deck and I'll do the trick with that.\n\nSo you're saying this is a regulation deck?\n\nI'm saying believe in magic, you muggle.\n\nYou know, well, I'm happy\n\nLeonard's found someone.\n\nNot that anybody asked.\n\nHow many Star Trek uniforms do you have?\n\nJust two: everyday and dress.\n\nUh-huh.\n\nListen, we need to talk about something.\n\nOh, my God, you're breaking up with me!\n\nWhy would you take me out shopping and then break up with me?\n\nThat is so cruel!\n\nLeonard, I'm not breaking up with you.\n\nOh, okay.\n\nSo, what's up?\n\nIt's a little weird, your ex-girlfriend hanging out here all the time.\n\nI know.\n\nI usually never see my ex-girlfriends, unless their hard drives crash.\n\nI'm just saying, how would you feel if I was hanging out with my ex-boyfriend?\n\nUm, not great, I guess.\n\nBut Penny and I are just friends.\n\nI don't care.\n\nThis is a woman you have slept with.\n\nIf you want her around, then I have to wonder if maybe you're not ready to move on.\n\nNo, no-no-no, I'm ready!\n\nI gave up the gift of sight for you.\n\nIf that's not moving on, what is?\n\nYou need to cut the cord with Penny.\n\nOh... okay.\n\nYou don't sound very confident.\n\nNo, no, I'm confident.\n\nIts not like I'm unfamiliar with the \"get lost\" conversation.\n\nAlthough, this will be the first time I'll be the one saying it.\n\nThank you.\n\nI appreciate it.\n\nSure.\n\nOh, God, you smell so good.\n\nOf course, that could just be my other senses getting stronger.\n\nHypothetically, if I had access to a Lieutenant Uhura uniform, would you wear it?\n\nLeonard, it is a source of great pain to me and my family that my brother has that outfit in his wardrobe.\n\nCan we not discuss it?\n\nI'm sorry. Never mind.\n\nAnd was your card the jack of diamonds?\n\nOh, unbelievable!\n\nKnow how he did it yet?\n\nUm...\n\nAw, he has the same look my little nephew gets when he can't figure out how I got his nose.\n\nYou know, I have some remedial magic tricks that might be more your speed.\n\nLike, ooh, look!\n\nThe pencil's rubber!\n\nHey, I think I know how you did the card trick.\n\nOh, please, if I don't know, you don't know.\n\nThat's axiomatic.\n\nCome here.\n\nYou're right.\n\nNot too bad for someone who doesn't know what \"axiomatic\" means.\n\nOh, hi.\n\nHey, you.\n\nWhat happened with the contacts?\n\nOne of them's upstairs.\n\nThe other one sort of slipped back into my skull.\n\nHey, is that one of the new shirts Priya got you?\n\nYeah.\n\nYou don't wanna wash that.\n\nNo?\n\nNo, that's silk.\n\nSeriously, what would you do without me?\n\nYeah.\n\nYou know, I gotta tell you, I think you got a real winner with Priya.\n\nYeah, me, too.\n\nShe seems really sweet.\n\nBelieve me, you do not want to take that for granted.\n\nThere are a lot of bitches out there.\n\nYeah, bitches are the worst.\n\nAll right, I'll see you later.\n\nUh, Penny, there's something\n\nI have to tell you.\n\nWhat?\n\nOkay, uh, how do I put this?\n\nUm... are you familiar with\n\nDarwin's observation of the finches in the Galapagos Islands?\n\nDid they make a movie about it?\n\nNo.\n\nThen no.\n\nAll right, well, anyway, Darwin observed that when two groups of finches competed over the same food source, eventually one of them would evolve a different beak shape so they could feed on something else.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo what do you think we can learn from that behavior that we can apply to our own lives?\n\nUh, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush?\n\nSure, that has birds in it.\n\nIt's fun talking to you,\n\nLeonard; I always learn stuff.\n\nI'm sorry, but I'm gonna count that.\n\nDo you really have to wear that in bed?\n\nYeah. The doctor didn't want me to rub my eye during the night.\n\nIt was either this or one of those giant neck cones.\n\nSo did you get to talk to Penny?\n\nOh, yes.\n\nIndeed, I did.\n\nAnd?\n\nShe completely understood everything I said. Case closed.\n\nWas she upset?\n\nMaybe, but that's not my problem.\n\nShe's not my girlfriend, you are.\n\nI hope you weren't cruel to her.\n\nIs the autumn cruel for letting the flowers die, or is that just nature's way?\n\nLeonard?\n\nLeonard?\n\nLeonard?\n\nWhat?!\n\nI think I figured out\n\nWolowitz's magic trick, and I need you to pick a card.\n\nI am not opening that door, Sheldon!\n\nAs you wish.\n\nPick a card, put it back, and prepare to be amazed.\n\nDid you pick one?\n\nYep.\n\nIs this your card?\n\nNope.\n\nDrat.\n\nIs this your card?\n\nNo.\n\nI'll be right back.\n\nPick a card, Sheldon.\n\nNow look at it, and put it back in the deck.\n\nNow do you remember your card?\n\nOf course I do, I have an eidetic memory.\n\nMy apologies.\n\nNow shuffle the cards.\n\nShuffling.\n\nWait here.\n\nProcessing image, cross-referencing...\n\nWhatcha doin'?\n\nI'm reverse engineering\n\nWolowitz's magic trick.\n\nWhat's up with the infrared cameras?\n\nI'm measuring residual heat levels on the playing cards to determine which one's been touched.\n\nBy the way, if you hope to have children,\n\nI suggest you switch from briefs to boxers.\n\nYour testicles look a tad warm.\n\nHoly crap, are you connected to the Oak Ridge\n\nNational Laboratory?\n\nYes. I'm using their\n\nCray supercomputer to analyze shuffling patterns.\n\nSheldon, that computer is used for national defense.\n\nHacking into it is a federal crime.\n\nRelax, we're not under attack right now.\n\nOkay, I'm leaving before the black helicopters get here.\n\nAnd is this my card?\n\nRats!\n\nI wonder if Howard used a radioactive tracer.\n\nWhere am I going to find uranium-235 this time of night?\n\nCome on, CraigsList.\n\nIs it racist that I took you to an Indian restaurant?\n\nIt's okay, I like Indian food.\n\nOr as you probably call it back home, \"food.\"\n\nWhy didn't you wear your contacts?\n\nDon't you like them?\n\nNo, no, I do.\n\nIt's just I knew I was having curry tonight and I only want one part of my body to burn at a time.\n\nYou know... ...my company offered me a position here in Los Angeles.\n\nDoes that mean you'd relocate here permanently?\n\nMaybe. What do you think?\n\nI love it.\n\nThat's great!\n\nHi!\n\nHi! Just hang on.\n\nSmall world.\n\nYou did talk to her, didn't you?\n\nOf course, I did.\n\nI talked and talked and talked.\n\nHey! Look at Leonard in his fancy-ass grownup clothes.\n\nWay to go, Priya.\n\nFor once, he doesn't look like a mannequin in the boys' department.\n\nHey, did he tell you I saved the silk shirt?\n\nNo, he did not.\n\nHe was gonna throw it in the washing machine with his\n\nSpiderman underwear.\n\nThat's our Lenny, huh?\n\nYes, that's our Lenny.\n\nSo how's the food here?\n\nOh, wow, that is really, really good.\n\nOh, I'm sorry.\n\nYou guys are on a date.\n\nWe can hang out anytime. Have fun.\n\nBye.\n\nGood night.\n\nOh, that's, hot, hot, hot, hot!\n\nWhoo! It really sneaks up on ya, huh?\n\nAll right, I gotta go.\n\nIt is pretty spicy.\n\nOh, I've been meaning to tell you,\n\nI figured out your magic trick.\n\nReally?\n\nOh, yes.\n\nIn fact, I improved upon it.\n\nI'd love to see that.\n\nHow about you, Raj?\n\nBeefaroni and a show?\n\nHow do you turn that down?\n\nAll right.\n\nPick a card.\n\nOkay.\n\nBippity-boppity-boo.\n\nWhat's with the wand and the beep?\n\nThe wand is called showmanship, and the beep is none of your business.\n\nOh!

There's a big inspection coming up, and I don't want to lose my TV privileges.\n\nYou really need to let me take a look at that roommate agreement, one of these days.\n\nMm, I don't know.\n\nI get a lawyer, he gets a lawyer...\n\nIt's just easier to stand behind the tape.\n\nOh, by the way, a fellow at work said I could use his\n\nDodger tickets this weekend.\n\nDoes that sound like fun?\n\nYeah!\n\nDodgers are baseball, right?\n\nYou'll need to explain the game to me.\n\nMm, it's complicated.\n\nBut as I remember it, the essentials are \"get chosen last, get hit by the ball, cry, go home.\"\n\nWell, regardless,\n\nI've got four tickets.\n\nAnd I was thinking we can bring\n\nBernadette and Howard.\n\nShe's really interesting, and I bet I can get used to him.\n\nWell, it might not be a great idea to invite those two.\n\nWhy not?\n\nDon't tell anybody\n\nI told you, but I heard she might be breaking up with him.\n\nOh... too bad...\n\nAlthough I do know one person for whom that's good news.\n\nReally? Who?\n\nMy brother.\n\nHe's got a big crush on Bernadette.\n\nWhat?\n\nYou're kidding!\n\nNo. I found poems he wrote about her.\n\nVery disturbing. \"Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet.\"\n\nWow, that's hard to believe.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd for years, everyone in my family was convinced that <i>he</i> was the clarinet enthusiast.\n\nHmm. What's that piece of tape?\n\nOh, that one doesn't apply to you. You sit.\n\nHey!\n\nHey! How's it going?\n\nNot too bad. Did you hear about Howard and Bernadette? 'Course I heard about it.\n\nHow did you hear about it?\n\nI heard about it from Sheldon.\n\nHe got it from Amy.\n\nOh, damn it.\n\nI told Amy that in the strictest confidence.\n\nBoy, some people are such blabbermouths.\n\nWell, whatever.\n\nI'm sure Bernadette can do better.\n\nDo you think a sexually ambivalent\n\nIndian astrophysicist with selective mutism and alcohol issues is better than a hundred-pound Jewish guy who lives with his mom?\n\nYou are kidding.\n\nRaj likes Bernadette?\n\nI didn't say Raj.\n\nWho said <i>Raj?</i>\n\nOkay, give.\n\nHow do you know?\n\nDid he tell you?\n\nNo.\n\nWell, then who?\n\nI can't say...\n\nPriya told you.\n\nWhat a little gossip.\n\nYou know, not an attractive quality in a woman, Leonard.\n\nNot judging, just my opinion.\n\nWell, The point is, if this got out, it would destroy Howard and Raj's friendship.\n\nYou don't have to worry.\n\nUnlike Amy and Priya,\n\nI know how to keep a secret.\n\nYou're the one who told Amy in the first place.\n\nIn confidence!\n\nHello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy.\n\nHow are you?\n\nWe're very rich in a very poor country.\n\nSo, all in all, can't complain.\n\nSo, Priya, how are enjoying staying with your brother?\n\nIt's fine. But if\n\nI'm going to stay in Los Angeles much longer,\n\nI think I should get my own place.\n\nWhy?\n\nIs Rajesh not making you feel comfortable?\n\nRajesh, why aren't you making your sister comfortable?\n\nI am making her comfortable.\n\nBesides, she's not sleeping here half the time anyw...\n\nWhat?\n\nWhere are you sleeping, Priya?\n\nIt's a figure of speech, Daddy.\n\nIt means I-I work late.\n\nPlease tell me you're not dating an American.\n\nI knew this would happen.\n\nRajesh, are you letting your sister date that little Howard boy?\n\nNow, hold on. If she is dating an American, that's not a bad way to go.\n\nHe's Jewish.\n\nThose chaps are very successful, and they don't drink a lot.\n\nIt-It doesn't matter.\n\nHoward has a girlfriend.\n\nFor now.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nI'll tell you later.\n\nIs something going on with him and Bernadette?\n\nWho's Bernadette?\n\nDoesn't sound Jewish.\n\nYou can't tell by that.\n\nWinona Ryder is Jewish.\n\nOkay, we're getting off the subject.\n\nRajesh, I want you to try harder to make your sister feel welcome.\n\nThank you, Daddy.\n\nDon't worry. Everything I have,\n\nI share with her.\n\nIncluding my friend Leon...\n\nGood night, Mummy.\n\nGood night, Daddy.\n\nOh, my God,\n\nI think you broke my toe!\n\nYou should have kept your mouth shut.\n\nFair enough.\n\nNow, what's up with Clarinet...?\n\nBernadette!\n\nI've been thinking about\n\nDr. Greene's efforts to make science palatable for the masses.\n\nOh, yeah?\n\nWhat about it?\n\nThat's all. I've just been thinking about it.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about fractal equations.\n\nNow I'm thinking about the origin of the phrase \"train of thought.\"\n\nNow I'm thinking about trains.\n\nAre you listening to this guy?\n\nHmm? Oh, I'm sorry.\n\nI was somewhere else.\n\nLucky bastard.\n\nNow I'm thinking about Jell-O.\n\nSo what's up?\n\nIt's a Bernadette thing.\n\nOh, no. I hope everything's okay.\n\nWhatever it is, we're here for you.\n\nYou can tell us anything.\n\nYeah. Good or devastating.\n\nI'm gonna ask her to marry me.\n\nMarry you?   - What?\n\nYeah.\n\nI just need to figure out the right time to pop the question.\n\nOh, I'd wait.\n\nNo rush, no rush.\n\nOh, great. It's my cousin David about the ring.\n\nHey, David, what'd you find?\n\nSure, a half a caret's fine.\n\nHer freakishly small hands make anything look big.\n\nIt's one of the reasons\n\nI love her.\n\nMan, he's going to be blindsided.\n\nI know. It'll be awful.\n\nWhy are you smiling?\n\nYeah, Raj, why?\n\nUh, a smile means something different in my country.\n\nYou know, tears of joy, smile of sadness.\n\nIndia's a goofy place.\n\nOh, I'm back to trains.\n\nWoo-woo.\n\nDid I tell you our lab got a grant to study addiction?\n\nNo.\n\nFascinating work.\n\nI recently trained a capuchin monkey to smoke cigarettes.\n\nHave you learned anything?\n\nYes. He looks much cooler than the non-smoking monkeys.\n\nAlthough it's not much of a contest.\n\nThe other monkeys just sit around and masturbate.\n\nIf you don't mind, I'd like to stop listening to you and start talking.\n\nBy all means.\n\nHoward has announced his intention to propose marriage to Bernadette.\n\nI don't understand.\n\nThe original piece of gossip indicated an impending breakup.\n\nI know.\n\nThe group consensus is that his proposal will be met with an humiliating, soul-crushing rejection.\n\nEveryone was set a-twitter.\n\nAlthough oddly, no one tweeted.\n\nIt's not surprising that the story has captured the attention of our little circle of friends.\n\nAre you familiar with meme theory?\n\nI'm familiar with everything, but go on.\n\nMeme theory suggests that items of gossip are like living things that seek to reproduce using humans as their host.\n\nI'm no stranger to memetic epidemiology.\n\nAt Johnson Elementary School, the phrase \"Shelly Cooper's a smelly pooper\" spread like wildfire.\n\nI should think so.\n\nThat's gold.\n\nYour meme hypothesis does intrigue me.\n\nHow might we examine this more closely?\n\nDo you have any ethical qualms regarding human experimentation?\n\nIt's one of the few forms of interaction with people that I don't find repellent.\n\nWe need to fabricate a tantalizing piece of gossip.\n\nAnd a second non-tantalizing piece to use as a control.\n\nThen we'll track its progress through our social group and interpret the results through the competing academic prisms of memetic theory, algebraic gossip and epidemiology.\n\nLook at you, getting me to engage in the social sciences.\n\nYou're a vixen,\n\nAmy Farrah Fowler.\n\nOh, hey, Amy. What's up?\n\nSheldon and I engaged in sexual intercourse.\n\nIn other news, I'm thinking of starting an herb garden. Mum's the word. Gotta go.\n\nOh, hey, Raj, what are you doing here?\n\nI just felt like drinking alone... because I'm deep and dark.\n\nUh-huh.\n\nSo, uh, Howard's not here?\n\nNo. It's just one of those times when it's just you and me.\n\nLike when the three of us went to the movies and you and I waited outside the bathroom while Howard threw up\n\nRed Vines and Cherry Coke.\n\nDo you remember that?\n\nYeah.\n\nMe, too.\n\nGood times.\n\nAlright, 16 wants to order appetizers.\n\nOh, thanks.\n\nThis was nice.\n\nWhat the hell are you doing?\n\nHoward is your best friend, and that is his girlfriend.\n\nYou should be ashamed of yourself.\n\nI was when I came in, but it's amazing what liquor does to guilt.\n\nBesides what you might not know is...\n\nBernadette is planning on breaking up with Howard.\n\nWell, I know that.\n\nHow do you know that?\n\nMy sister told me.\n\nOh, that gossipy bitch!\n\nNo offense.\n\nNone taken.\n\nYou should hear how she talks about you.\n\nOkay, listen, just because Howard and Bernadette are having problems, does not mean you should be here sniffing around.\n\nWhat can I do?\n\nI can't stop thinking about her.\n\nAll right, try thinking about this...\n\nSheldon and Amy had sex.\n\nShut your ass!\n\nYeah, it's true.\n\nAmy told me.\n\nHow did that even happen?\n\nDid they know that's what they were doing when they were doing it?\n\nI-I guess they just figured it out at some point.\n\nWow.\n\nI can't believe old\n\nSmelly Pooper finally got laid.\n\nHey.\n\nHey.\n\nHope you're hungry.\n\nInteresting.\n\nA friendly sentiment in this country, cruel taunt in the Sudan.\n\nIt's a lesson in context.\n\nWill Amy be joining us for dinner?\n\nYes, I believe so.\n\nGood, good.\n\nEverything... okay between you two?\n\nYes.\n\nWhy do you ask?\n\nNo reason.\n\nI was just talking to Raj, and he mentioned what a lovely glow she has these days.\n\nDid he mean as if she'd been out in the sun, tending an herb garden without wearing a hat or sunblock?\n\nNo.\n\nThat's not what he meant.\n\nWell, we may never know.\n\nAs my mother would say, the Asians are an inscrutable folk.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me,\n\nI have work to do.\n\nYeah, you do.\n\nYou dog, you.\n\nDid you get that?\n\nEvery word.\n\nOur false gossip meme appears to have reached node lambda.\n\nThis is moving faster than we thought.\n\nAgreed.\n\nIt appears the rate of gossip transmission is proportional to the number of nodes squared.\n\nI must say, Amy, pretending to have intercourse with you is giving me a great deal of satisfaction.\n\nSlow down, Sheldon.\n\nI'm not quite there yet.\n\nPass the soy sauce.\n\nSure.\n\nBernadette just asked about my sexual encounter with you.\n\nThe meme has reached full penetration.\n\nPun intended?\n\nNo. Happy accident.\n\nThis is remarkable.\n\nTook less than 24 hours.\n\nI should let you know that she asked for details about our dalliance.\n\nInteresting.\n\nSo it went beyond the mere fact of coitus to a \"blow by blow,\" as it were.\n\nPun intended?\n\nI'm sorry. What pun?\n\nNot important.\n\nI described your lovemaking as \"aloof, but effective.\"\n\nI wish you hadn't done that.\n\nThat's going to make me a chick magnet, and I'm so busy as it is.\n\nHey, everybody,\n\nI got something I want to ask Bernadette, and I can't think of a better time than when I'm with all my friends.\n\nOh, hold on, Howard.\n\nThere's lots of better times.\n\nLeonard, please.\n\nThe man is talking.\n\nLet him get it out, and let the chips fall where they may.\n\nThank you.\n\nBernadette Maryann\n\nRostenkowski...\n\nOh, God.\n\nWhat's happening?\n\nI know things haven't been perfect with us, and we've had our problems, but I just have to tell you, from the moment I...\n\nHoward, let me just stop you right here.\n\nThis is it.\n\nYes.\n\nYes, what?\n\nYes, I will marry you.\n\nYou will?\n\nYou will?\n\nI will.\n\nI will!\n\nOh, I love you so much.\n\nOh, I love you, too.\n\nCongratulations!\n\nOh, it's so exciting.\n\nI wonder what changed her mind.\n\nPerhaps your talk of my sexual prowess renewed her faith in love.\n\nAs good an explanation as any.\n\nThat's great...\n\nOh, hey, Amy.\n\nBernadette just texted me.\n\nHoward proposed?\n\nYes, not important.\n\nJust stopped by to let you know I'm getting orthotics.\n\nAlso, I'm carrying\n\nSheldon's baby.\n\nMum's the word.\n\nYou're pregnant?!\n\nWow.

No.\n\nMy client does not waive reading of the charges.\n\nLEONARD:\n\nOh.\n\nCool. I've got a lawyer.\n\nAnd I've seen her naked.\n\nProceed.\n\nVery well. \"Count the first: \"On or about the 28th day of April, \"the accused did knowingly and with malice aforethought \"deny access to the shared bathroom \"in a time of emergency, to wit, my back teeth were floating. \"Count the second: the accused exceeded \"the agreed upon occupancy of the shower, \"to wit, one, unless we are under attack by water-soluble aliens.\"\n\nCan I see the roommate agreement?\n\nUm, it's fairly technical.\n\nI think I can handle it.\n\nTop of her class,\n\nCambridge University.\n\nLicensed to practice law in three countries and your face.\n\nAll right, based on a cursory reading, it doesn't look like you have much of a case, Sheldon.\n\nDo so, do so.\n\nOh, I'm afraid not.\n\nSection seven here, on the right to enter the bathroom in emergency situations, is not specific as to what constitutes an emergency.\n\nOh, that's ridiculous!\n\nA bathroom emergency is self-explanatory.\n\nIs it? If Leonard forgot to trim his nose hair, could he barge in while you were showering?\n\nIrrelevant. Leonard doesn't trim his nose hair.\n\nHe thinks because he's short nobody can see up there.\n\nMy point is, Sheldon, the legal principle is, ambiguity in a contract benefits the party that did not draft it, in this case, Leonard.\n\nSo much for count one.\n\nBut...\n\nThere's no buts, Sheldon; that's how the law works.\n\nSchooled!\n\nAs for the shower capacity issue,\n\nI cite addendum J. \"When Sheldon showers second, any and all measures shall be taken to ensure an adequate supply of hot water.\"\n\nI believe this supercedes the occupancy issue.\n\nSuperceded!\n\nThis isn't over.\n\nNo offense, but shower sex with you is now the <i>second</i> best thing that's happened today.\n\nMmm, Greek food on pizza night?\n\nThis is the most delightfully cruel thing we've done to Sheldon since we left that fake message from Stephen Hawking on his voice mail.\n\nSeriously?\n\nI wish to discuss your theories of black holes.\n\nMeet me at the Randy's Donut by the airport at 2:00 a.m.\n\nWhat is that you're eating?\n\nTonight is pizza night.\n\nI'd like to refer that to my attorney.\n\nAccording to what I see here,\n\nThursday nights are Franconi's pizza night.\n\nYes, and when Franconi's went out of business, we switched to Graziano's.\n\nThat's interesting.\n\nCan you just switch restaurants like that, Priya?\n\nA good question, Howard.\n\nTurns out you can't.\n\nAccording to the document you drew up, Sheldon, the selection of a new takeout restaurant requires public hearings and a 60-day comment period.\n\nWere those criteria met?\n\nNo.\n\nOpa! Opa!\n\nOpa!\n\nThis is Greek food?\n\nLeonard, you hate Greek food.\n\nNot as much as you.\n\nFine. I'm nothing if not adaptable.\n\nI got you the lamb kabob.\n\nThank you.\n\nIf you think about it,\n\nGreek food isn't that far from Italian food.\n\nThey share a spice palette.\n\nAnd what a civilization is the Greeks'!\n\nThey gave us science, democracy, and little cubes of charred meat that taste like sweat.\n\nPenny?

Last week we smoked cigars and pretended to be dragons.\n\nReally, Amy?\n\nTobacco and alcohol?\n\nNeed I remind you not a lot of scientific discoveries were made by people having a good time?\n\nWhy did you bring him?\n\nHe's harshing my buzz.\n\nI felt sorry for him.\n\nPriya's giving him a hard time.\n\nOoh, the Priya bashing's starting early. Yay!\n\nOkay, what's up with those pantsuits?\n\nI need some context.\n\nPantsuits suck.\n\nAnd that opens her up to justifiable ridicule for wearing them.\n\nGood one, Bernadette.\n\nSee? Ca-razy.\n\nWhee...!\n\nYou smell like baby powder.\n\nIt's talc.\n\nBut as that's a primary ingredient of baby powder,\n\nI understand your confusion.\n\nOh, I'm not confused at all.\n\nYou're like a sexy toddler.\n\nI don't know how to process that.\n\nI do. \u266a Amy and Sheldon sitting in a tree \u266a \u266a K-I-S-S-S-S-I-N-G. \u266a\n\nThat's too many S's for \"kissing.\"\n\nNot if they're doing it for a long time.\n\nSheldon... have you ever kissed a girl?\n\nOther than my mother, my sister and my Mee-Maw, no.\n\nBut in the interest of full disclosure,\n\nI was once on a bus and had to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to an elderly nun who passed out from heat exhaustion.\n\nEvery year I get a Christmas card from her, signed with far too many X's and O's.\n\nThat doesn't count.\n\nAren't you even a little curious?\n\nYeah, you're a scientist-- where is the curiosity?\n\nI'm available for experimentation.\n\nThank you.\n\nNot necessary.\n\nWe know everything there is to know about kissing.\n\nIt requires 34 facial muscles and 112 postural muscles.\n\nOh, blah, blah, blah.\n\nGive me some sugar, bestie.\n\nI'm certainly glad no one said they were curious about Aztec human sacrifice.\n\nHey, I know-- let's take Sheldon dancing.\n\nOoh, I totally want to see Sheldon dance.\n\nI bet he looks like a spider on a hot plate.\n\nNo, thank you, but for the record,\n\nI'm an excellent dancer.\n\nProficient in the rumba, waltz and cha-cha.\n\nReally?\n\nI don't see why that's surprising.\n\nI excel at so many things.\n\nYou've had my sourdough bread.\n\nDid you take dance lessons?\n\nAgainst my will.\n\nIn the South, preadolescent children are forced through a process called cotillion, which indoctrinates them with all the social graces and dance skills needed to function in 18th century Vienna.\n\nOh, we are so taking you dancing.\n\nNo, you most certainly are not.\n\nWell, what does your cotillion training say is expected of a gentleman when three ladies ask him to escort them to a dance soiree?\n\nI saved a nun's life.\n\nWhy am I being punished?\n\nPenny squeals)\n\nTake us someplace we can waltz.\n\nWhere you can what?\n\nWaltz.

Here you go.\n\nTwo lemonades, one iced tea and a root beer for Priya.\n\nIs it diet?\n\nThat's what you ordered.\n\nThank you.\n\nHey, have you and Howard started planning your wedding yet?\n\nYeah. We're thinking of having it on a cliff overlooking the ocean.\n\nNothing soothes those pre-wedding jitters like the thought of falling and drowning.\n\nWhat did your mother say when you told her you were getting married?\n\nHe hasn't told her yet.\n\nHe's waiting for the right time.\n\nI was thinking of weaving it into her eulogy.\n\nHoward, you've got to tell your mother.\n\nHey, have you told your parents you're dating this short glass of skim milk here?\n\nUh... that's different.\n\nFirst of all, we're not engaged; and second,\n\nIndian parents are very protective of their children.\n\nRight, right, whereas Jewish mothers take a casual, la-di-da approach to their sons.\n\nI gargled with tequila and may have swallowed a teeny bit.\n\nYou all right?\n\nFine.\n\nThank you for asking.\n\nI love you so much.\n\nFire demon.\n\nOoh, fire demon.\n\nSheldon's turning up the heat...\n\nTroll master.\n\nCheck it! Howard pulls one out from under the bridge. Nice!\n\nWater nymph.\n\nOh, yeah, she's got puddles in all the right places.\n\nCould you please play the game without commenting on every card?\n\nSorry.\n\nWalking tree.\n\nLast one.\n\nI'm taking a stroll and I'm sporting wood.\n\nOkay, the <i>Eagle</i> has landed.\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nBernadette and my mother are having a get-to-know-you lunch at the Old Town Deli.\n\nOh, that sounds lovely.\n\nHope so.\n\nOf course, if history is any indication, my mother will swallow her whole and spit out her bones like an owl.\n\nHave you met\n\nBernadette's parents?\n\nYou mean Adolf and Eva?\n\nNot yet.\n\nOne goose step at a time.\n\nSheldon, that's my water.\n\nOh, dear Lord!\n\nThat's not your water.\n\nI know.\n\nSHELDON:\n\nWhere's the mouthwash?! \"Where\" indeed.\n\nWOLOWITZ:\n\nMa, I'm home!\n\nWhere are you?\n\nMRS. WOLOWITZ:\n\nI'm in the toilet!\n\nSo, how'd it go?!\n\nMRS. WOLOWITZ:\n\nToo soon to say!\n\nI'm not done yet!\n\nNo, I mean lunch, today, with Bernadette!\n\nMRS. WOLOWITZ:\n\nOh!\n\nI had a pastrami sandwich.\n\nShe had eggplant lasagna.\n\nLike that's what a person orders in a Jewish deli.\n\nBesides food, did you get along?\n\nDid you talk?\n\nOh, sure! Did you know she's going to school to become a microbiologist?!\n\nNo, she never mentioned it.\n\nI bet she did and you didn't listen!\n\nYeah, that's probably it.\n\nSo, what do you think?\n\nDo you like her?\n\nShe's great, huh?\n\nShe's a lovely girl!\n\nCute as a button!\n\nThat's good to hear, 'cause I've got some news.\n\nI hope it's good news, because I've got nothing but disappointment in here!\n\nBernadette and I are getting married.\n\nMa?\n\nYou too busy bearing down?\n\nMa?\n\nOh, my God, Ma? Ma? Ma?\n\nStand back,\n\nI'm gonna break the door down!\n\nSon of a bitch!\n\nMa, help!\n\nHey.\n\nHello.\n\nHaven't seen you in a while.\n\nHow's it going?\n\nOh, other than waiting out the exponential growth period of the virulent organisms trooping through my microvilli into my circulatory system-- hunky-dory.\n\nDid I say something amusing?\n\nI don't know, maybe,\n\nI have no idea what you said.\n\nSo your mirth is merely a discharge of nervous energy with no semantic content at all?\n\nMy mirth. Classic.\n\nIs there a station coming up where I can board your giggling train of thought?\n\nIt's not a big deal, Sheldon.\n\nIt's just, ever since Leonard's been dating Raj's sister,\n\nI've had to keep my distance.\n\nI don't get to hear all your jibber-jabber.\n\nJibber-jabber?!\n\nI don't jibber-jabber.\n\nWhat are you doing at work these days?\n\nOh, I'm working on time-dependent backgrounds in string theory, specifically quantum field theory in \"d-dimensional\" de Sitter space.\n\nOkay, come on, even you have to admit that's jibber-jabber.\n\nInteresting, do you know where the phrase \"jibber-jabber\" comes from?\n\nOh, my God, you're about to jibber-jabber about jibber-jabber.\n\nHoward and his mother are at the hospital.\n\nCome on, we gotta go.\n\nOh, my God! What happened?\n\nI don't know, I just got a text.\n\nCome on, hurry.\n\nOkay.\n\nSheldon, let's go!\n\nTo a hospital?!\n\nFull of sick people?!\n\nOh, I don't think so.\n\nOkay, well, your friend and his mother are there, we're going.\n\nI can't.\n\nOh, don't tell me you're afraid of germs.\n\nNot all germs.\n\nJust the ones that will kill me.\n\nIt's the same way I'm not afraid of all steak knives-- just the ones that might be plunged in my thorax.\n\nFine, I'll tell Howard you didn't come because you're more concerned about your own well-being than his.\n\nI would think he would know that.\n\nOkay, you know what?\n\nYou are unbelievable.\n\nYou buy all these superhero T-shirts, but when it's time for you to step up and do the right thing, you just hide in the laundry room.\n\nFine, I'll go.\n\nJust for the record, my Aunt Ruth died in a hospital.\n\nShe went in to visit my Uncle Roger, caught something and bit the dust a week later.\n\nThe two of them now share a coffee can on my mother's mantel.\n\nSo I knocked down the bathroom door, picked up my poor unconscious mother, carried her to the car, and drove like a madman to the emergency room.\n\nYou're a real hero, Howard.\n\nNo, I did what any son would do.\n\nHang on a second-- you picked up your mother?\n\nHer own legs are barely able to do that.\n\nI was filled with adrenaline.\n\nIt happens to be how women lift cars off babies.\n\nYeah, I'm saying, it'd be easier to lift a car.\n\nWhat can I tell you?\n\nAfter I found the courage to put her pants back on,\n\nI was unstoppable.\n\nSo, how is she?\n\nThey're running tests--\n\nI don't know.\n\nIt may have been a heart attack or heart-attack-like event.\n\nWhat's the difference?\n\nA heart-attack-like event is an event that's like a heart attack.\n\nThanks for clearing that up.\n\nRegardless, coronary problems are eminently treatable.\n\nWhat's more likely going to kill Howard's mother are the antibiotic-resistant super-bugs festering in every nook and cranny of this hospital.\n\nOkay, you're not helping.\n\nDisagree.\n\nGo sit over there.\n\nI'll sit over there-- it looks cleaner.\n\nIs there a history of heart disease in your family?\n\nMy family is the history of heart disease.\n\nThere's a cave painting in France of one of my ancestors doing this:\n\nSo it's probably genetic.\n\nWell, maybe.\n\nMom also had just gotten some news that might have upset her.\n\nWhat?\n\nIt's not important.\n\nCome on, Howard,\n\nI'm going to be your wife.\n\nYou can share anything with me.\n\nYou'd think that.\n\nBut no.\n\nYou told her we were going to get married and she had a heart attack?\n\nYou can't take that personally.\n\nHow else is she supposed to take it?\n\nWhat you've got to keep in mind is that ever since my dad left,\n\nI've been the whole world to my mother.\n\nI mean, she'd be threatened by any woman who can give me what she can't.\n\nYou mean sexual intercourse?\n\nWell, when you say it like that you make it sound creepy.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nHoward's mother had a heart attack because I have sex with him and she can't.\n\nBernie, wait!\n\nI'll give you $1,000 if you'll drive me home.\n\nNice of you to come for Howard.\n\nWell, he's my friend.\n\nIt's what you do.\n\nI'm sorry, did\n\nI miss something?\n\nIt's just so weird.\n\nHoward Wolowitz is my friend.\n\nYou know, once he tried to stick his tongue down my throat and I broke his nose.\n\nThat's a little easier to believe than he's your friend.\n\nYeah, tell me about it.\n\nYou know, my brother had a group of friends like this in India.\n\nThey dressed up in leotards and goggles and called themselves the New Delhi\n\nPower Rangers.\n\nYou mean when he was little.\n\nNot as little as you'd want him to be.\n\nYou know, this stuff is horrible.\n\nYou want to see if we can find the cafeteria and get real coffee?\n\nSure.\n\nWe're going to the cafeteria to get some coffee.\n\nYou want anything?\n\nI'm fine.\n\nThat's nice that they're getting along.\n\nYour girlfriend and your ex-girlfriend are hanging out together?\n\nOh, yeah, that can only be good for you.\n\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nOne of them broke up with you.\n\nDo you really want her telling the other one why?\n\nI don't care.\n\nI don't have anything to hide.\n\nGood, good.\n\nThen you have nothing to worry about.\n\nNo, I do not.\n\nYou are a mean little man.\n\nYou'd think it'd be because my parents didn't love me, but actually they loved me a great deal.\n\nBernie, it's not you.\n\nShe's just set in her ways.\n\nHow can we be together if the thought of us getting married might kill your mother?\n\nIt's the circle of life, sweetie.\n\nOne day our son will marry someone and it will kill you.\n\nHoward, I have to go to the bathroom and no one will take me home.\n\nWhat's wrong with the bathroom here?\n\nPneumococcus, streptococcus, staphylococcus and other assorted coccuses.\n\nSheldon, my mother is on her deathbed and my fianc\u00e9e is grief-stricken over putting her there.\n\nI'm not taking you home.\n\nWill you at least go with me to the restroom here, so you can open the door and flush the urinal?\n\nNo!\n\nThis might be a good time to point out, Howard, that friendship requires a certain give and take.\n\nHold the door.\n\nMr. Wolowitz?\n\nIs she okay?\n\nIt wasn't a heart attack.\n\nShe's awake, she's resting comfortably-- we're still running tests.\n\nCan I see her?\n\nActually, she said, and I quote, she'd \"like to see the little Catholic girl first.\"\n\nMe? Why me?\n\nJews have been asking that for centuries.\n\nThere's no real good answer.\n\nOkay, well, wish me luck.\n\nDon't worry, you'll be fine.\n\nLet's just hide Mr. Cross.\n\nIf it touches her, it burns.\n\nYou brought a Catholic girl home to your mother?\n\nYeah.\n\nWhy don't I write you a prescription for Xanax.\n\nFinally.\n\nOh, what fresh hell is this?\n\nWait, you can't leave here, you've been exposed.\n\nNo, I haven't.\n\nIt's all good.\n\nYou want to talk about crazy mothers,\n\nLeonard's mom wouldn't give him any sort of approval growing up.\n\nOh, the poor thing.\n\nIt makes him desperate to please women.\n\nThat's why the foreplay goes on and on.\n\nIt does, doesn't it?\n\nIt's like he's trying to win a prize.\n\nA word of advice-- don't doze off.\n\nYou will never hear the end of it.\n\nHelp me!\n\nCome back!\n\nPenny!\n\nThere are a couple of things I did with Penny that might be a little silly, but...\n\nLike what?\n\nEvery once in a while, before we'd go to bed,\n\nI'd put on a little show for her.\n\nWhat do you mean \"a show\"?\n\nWell, you know, the way I took my clothes off.\n\nLike, to music?\n\nI'd look pretty stupid if there was no music.\n\nSo you'd do a striptease?\n\nI wasn't swinging around a pole.\n\nGood, good.\n\nThere was one time\n\nI put body glitter on.\n\nWell, I don't think you have to worry about Penny telling my sister that.\n\nNo, she wouldn't.\n\nYour big problem is me telling her.\n\nYou really are a mean little man.\n\nOh, God, that's so true.\n\nI know, right?\n\nHey, what took you guys so long?\n\nOh, we were just chatting.\n\nThat's nice.\n\nWhat about?\n\nWe were just comparing notes about how you are in the sack.\n\nThat's funny.\n\nYeah.\n\nWhat if she wasn't kidding?\n\nIt doesn't matter.\n\nI'm the king of foreplay.\n\nHey, how'd it go?\n\nYou're a putz.\n\nYou know what that means?\n\nYeah. Do you?\n\nYour mother just taught it to me.\n\nShe thinks she got food poisoning from that deli and she just wanted to make sure I was okay.\n\nAnd are you?\n\nNo, because I'm engaged to a putz.\n\nYou let me believe I was the reason she had a heart attack.\n\nWell, based on the available evid--\n\nShut up!\n\nShe said I'm a wonderful girl and that you're lucky to have me.\n\nWhere are you going?\n\nTo the toilet!\n\nIs that okay with you?!\n\nIs it just me, or does she sound sexy when she's angry?\n\nMountain Elf.\n\nHe takes the elf from off the shelf.\n\nHell Hounds.\n\nHell Hounds-- who let the Satanic dogs out?\n\nWho? Who-who?\n\nColossal Serpent.\n\nI got a colossal serpent right here.\n\nMust you?\n\nSorry, I'm just trying to cheer my buddy up.\n\nRotting Zombie.\n\nSheldon's new\n\nFacebook photo.\n\nZandor, Wizard of the North.\n\nHa!

Sorry, sorry.\n\nCan I tell you a secret?\n\nYeah.\n\nI screwed up.\n\nLeonard's a great guy.\n\nNever should have broken up with him.\n\nWell, uh, to paraphrase\n\nShakespeare: \"It's better to have loved and lost \"than to stay home every night and download increasingly shameful pornography. \"\n\nOhh... you poor baby.\n\nWhat's wrong with me, Penny?\n\nNothing, nothing.\n\nYou know, if we weren't friends, and you hadn't brought up that creepy pornography story,\n\nI'd be on you like the speed of light squared on matter to make energy.\n\nHey, you totally got that right! \"E=mc2.\"\n\nI listen.\n\nI have no idea what it means, but I listen.\n\nTo friendship.\n\nTo friendship.\n\nSHELDON: Would you booze hounds please stop that infernal clinking?!\n\nAnd the answer was elephant!\n\nMmm.\n\nMmm.\n\nLeonard, sweetheart, we're kissing, not eating hot soup.\n\nSorry.\n\nThat's my parents on video chat.\n\nGo hide in the bedroom.\n\nOh, come on!\n\nWhy don't we just tell them that we're dating?\n\nOh, we've been through this.\n\nIt's not the time.\n\nWhen is the time?\n\nI've got five brothers and sisters.\n\nOne of them is bound to screw up real big, and then I'll tell my parents about you.

I had a lot more fun with Amy than I thought I would.\n\nWhat exact do you mean by that?\n\nWell, it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time.\n\nAlthough, truth be told, my groin's a little worse for wear.\n\nOw!\n\nWhy did you do that?\n\nTo send a message: she is not for you.\n\nWhat?\n\nNot for you!\n\nGood morning, handsome.\n\nMorning, Mom.\n\nIt's me.\n\nYes, it is, and you're so pretty in the morning.\n\nYour mom and I made you breakfast.\n\nOh, wow.\n\nSo you guys are getting along?\n\nYeah, I guess.\n\nWe're very different people, Howard, so communication's a little tricky.\n\nMRS.

I made you smooth.\n\nYou were an idiot.\n\nWhatever, dude.\n\nShe kissed me.\n\nIt might've been on your lips, but it was my kiss.\n\nOh, fine.

Sorry, bud.\n\nWait, hang on.\n\nDoubles.\n\nRoll again.\n\nOkay, get this.\n\nIt doesn't matter if he's showering her with gifts, because the Koothrappalis are vastly wealthy.\n\nWhat do you mean \"vastly wealthy\"?\n\nWell, \"wealthy\" means a lot of money. \"Vastly\" means even more.\n\nI'm not sure what's tripping you up.\n\nLook, I know they have money.\n\nI don't think it's that much.\n\nNo, you're wrong.\n\nAs you know, a few years ago,\n\nI achieved one of my lesser dreams and became a notary public.\n\nWell, from time to time,\n\nI notarize banking documents for Raj.\n\nThe Koothrappalis aren't just rich, they're Richie Rich rich.\n\nWell, so how much is that?\n\nAbout halfway between\n\nBruce Wayne and Scrooge McDuck.\n\nWhat the hell?\n\nThe last time we went to the zoo, that son of a bitch made me buy him a churro.\n\nListen, guys, I'm sorry,\n\nI don't mean to be rude, but I need to go call Raj's sister, who I love so much.\n\nSo vastly much.\n\nOkay, so he's got money, and it's a few gifts and a car.\n\nAnd she got him to pay off all her credit cards.\n\nWhat? He paid off her credit cards?\n\nDamn it, I could've dated Raj for a couple months.\n\nBut I-I wouldn't have, because\n\nI'm not that kind of girl.\n\nWe should really talk to Raj.\n\nHe's not going to listen, he's in love.\n\nCan't figure out what to do?\n\nI remember those days.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me,\n\nI have to... stay right here.\n\nYeah, this is a bad idea.\n\nWe should go.\n\nNo.\n\nI'm the one that introduced him to her.\n\nI've got to say something.\n\nWow.\n\nYou're engaged to my friend.\n\nHey, Bernadette doesn't mind where I get my motor running, as long as I park in the right garage.\n\nI can't believe you're engaged to my friend.\n\nOh, here she comes.\n\nSmart. Whisper so the deaf chick can't hear you.\n\nHi.\n\nOh, hey, hi.\n\nNice to see you.\n\nUm, can we talk to you about Raj?\n\nShe says, \"Sure, what about him\"\"\n\nOkay, um, gosh, how do I start?\n\nUm, see, Raj is kind of naive.\n\nI mean, he hasn't dated a whole lot of women.\n\nAnd I'm concerned that, without meaning to, you might be taking advantage of him.\n\nYou know, by letting him buy you a bunch of expensive things.\n\nAnd I-I...\n\nHoward, focus.\n\nTell her what I'm saying.\n\nRight.\n\nAre you a gold digger or not?\n\nOh, uh, something, something, who the something do you think you are?\n\nMind your own something business and go something yourself.\n\nOh.\n\nWait, I got this now.\n\nI'm so mad at you!\n\nOkay, wait...\n\nHow dare you ambush my girlfriend at the gym!\n\nWe didn't mean for it to be an ambush.\n\nJust, it's kind of impossible not to sneak up on deaf people.\n\nAnd hey, since when are you so chatty?\n\nI'm hammered.\n\nRaj, come here.\n\nThis girl is trouble.\n\nI mean, what kind of relationship is it where you buy her gifts and she gives you sex?\n\nThe best one I ever had!\n\nOkay, come on.\n\nYou know you can do better.\n\nAha.\n\nI see what's going on here.\n\nYou and I had our crazy night together, and now you can't stand to see me with another woman.\n\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!\n\nIt's okay.\n\nI can't get mad at your feelings.\n\nI don't have feelings.\n\nYeah, that's good.\n\nKeep telling yourself that.\n\nHe is cuter now that I know he's rich.\n\nI have a surprise for you.\n\nCover your eyes.\n\nOpen them.\n\nIt's a real ruby.\n\nIt was a little expensive, but no one can put a price on love.\n\nAlthough, the people at Cartier took a pretty good shot at it.\n\nOh, Mummy, Daddy.\n\nWhat a nice surprise.\n\nNo, it's not a nice surprise, it's a bad surprise.\n\nPenny called us.\n\nPenny?\n\nShe told us you're spending all our money on your new girlfriend.\n\nI just got her a couple of things.\n\nShe gives me things, too.\n\nYeah, yeah, I'm a gynecologist.\n\nI know exactly what she gives you.\n\nYou need to find a nice\n\nIndian girl from a good family.\n\nIf you keep seeing this woman, you're cut off.\n\nWhat? You're going to make me choose between the woman I love and the money I... have very strong feelings for?\n\nIt's up to you.\n\nWell, I choose love.\n\nYou're an idiot.\n\nLove doesn't last.\n\nWell, he's going to find out eventually.\n\nThink about it.\n\nMy parents are making me choose between money and you.\n\nI choose you.\n\nNo, I think we'll have to return the car.\n\nAnd that necklace, yeah, that, too.\n\nBut none of those things matter, because we have something better.\n\nWe have love.\n\nOh, Penny, I hurt so bad.\n\nI know, I know.\n\nSometimes I put the TV on mute just to pretend she's still with me.\n\nBut I can't watch the closed captioning without crying.\n\nOh, I'm so sorry.\n\nI wish I could make you feel better.\n\nSeriously?\n\nI'm heartbroken and you're hitting on me?\n\nWhat?! No!\n\nLook, Penny, you're great, but I had a long talk with my parents, and they said if I date an\n\nIndian girl, I get a Maserati.\n\nMmm.\n\nOh, cheesecake, you're just as good as a woman, even though I can't have sex with you.\n\nTry throwing it in the microwave for a few seconds.\n\nShould I use the rest room or wait until we get home?\n\nCome on, papa needs to void his bladder.\n\nOh, that's not what you want to see after three buttermilks.\n\nHere you go, boys.\n\nI'll pick it up when you're ready.\n\nThanks for dinner, buddy.\n\nYeah, real big of you.\n\nHurry, hurry, hurry.\n\nOh, and don't cheap out on the tip.\n\nWe all know you're loaded now. == sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "6fed6e9c-8a82-43a7-af16-1fa922a391aa": {"__data__": {"id_": "6fed6e9c-8a82-43a7-af16-1fa922a391aa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "b5ee6cc1a38d6572f7b6366e5ee0a9795bc2fc0970d0c09321939ebc62ea07fd", "text": "  \ufeff1\n\nIt's from\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nI don't know.\n\nIf we're going to start a fantasy sword collection-- and I've long thought we should-- is this really the sword to start with?\n\nWhat did you have in mind?\n\nWell, off the top of my head,\n\nI'd have to go with Excalibur.\n\nIt gives you the right to rule England.\n\nIt would be a replica of a movie prop.\n\nFair enough.\n\nIt'd give you the right to rule a replica of England.\n\nWell, they don't have an Excalibur here, so what do you want to do?\n\nMm.

You're right.\n\nOkay, let's try this again.\n\nBernadette, an opportunity has come up that impacts both of us, and I'd like to discuss it.\n\nOkay.\n\nI've been offered a chance to go up to the International\n\nSpace Station for three weeks.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on that?\n\nWell, first of all, thank you for including me in the decision-making process.\n\nHey, we're a team.\n\nSo, what do you think?\n\nNo.\n\nNo?\n\nNo.\n\nWhy not?\n\nHoward, my father was a police officer.\n\nWe never knew from one night to the next if he was going to come home alive.\n\nIt was horrible.\n\nAnd I don't want to live that way with you.\n\nHey, my father abandoned me and my mother when I was 11.\n\nWe never saw him again.\n\nOh, boo-hoo, you're not going to space!\n\nPretty cool about\n\nHoward, huh?\n\nDon't talk to me as if nothing's happened between us.\n\nAnd yes, it sure is, buddy.\n\nFor God's sake, will you stop with the Schroer stuff.\n\nWould you prefer a simpler application of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, in which I could either know where you are or whether I like you, but not both?\n\nYou never stop talking, do you?\n\nI don't understand.\n\nWhat differences does it make if Leonard goes to\n\nWil Wheaton's party?\n\nWil Wheaton is\n\nSheldon's mortal enemy.\n\nMortal enemy?\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSheldon, I know you're a bit of a left-handed monkey wrench, but... you really have a mortal enemy?\n\nIn fact, I have 61 of them.\n\nWould you like to see the list?\n\nOh, say no, say no, say no, say no.\n\nYou just got off the list.\n\nWould you like back on it?\n\nThis'll just take a moment.\n\nIt's on a five and a quarter inch floppy.\n\nA floppy disk?\n\nWell, I started the list when I was nine.\n\nHow did Wil Wheaton get on the list?\n\nOh! Oh, God!\n\nOh! Come on!\n\nAs a child,\n\nI loved Wesley Crusher,\n\nWil Wheaton's character on <i>Star Trek.</i>\n\nSo, I drove for hours by bus to a <i>Star Trek</i> convention at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear, so that I could get my Wesley\n\nCrusher action figure signed.\n\nBut he never showed, because apparently, it was cooler for him to be the lower-left corner on <i>Hollywood Squares.</i>\n\nOh, damn!\n\nThe floppy failed.\n\nWell, whoever was in charge of quality control at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989, congratulations, you just made the list.\n\nHoward?\n\nChange your mind about sex?\n\nI'm still mad, but I'll do it.\n\nNo, I've just been thinking.\n\nIt doesn't matter if I'm afraid for your safety.\n\nI don't want to be the person who stands between you and your dreams.\n\nReally?\n\nReally.\n\nIf going into space means that much to you,\n\nI will never say another word about it.\n\nThank you.\n\nI love you.\n\nI love you, too.\n\nSo, sex now?\n\nOkay.\n\nI just forgot to brush my teeth.\n\nI'll be right back. \u266a Oh, baby \u266a \u266a I'm \u266a \u266a I'm not in love with you... \u266a\n\nMRS.

You're not only our first astronaut.\n\nYou're also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed.\n\nYou're like a rock star.\n\nLittle bit.\n\nI hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you.\n\nInteresting.\n\nYou see betrayal in others, but not yourself.\n\nGoing to Wheaton's party is not betraying you.\n\nOh, of course you would have to believe that.\n\nEvil always thinks it's doing right. \"Excuse me, Stormtrooper.\n\nThese are the droids you're looking for.\"\n\nI'm going to a party.\n\nI'm not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO over to the empire!\n\nNot yet.\n\nSo, what's gonna happen next?\n\nAre you and Bernadette going to break up?\n\nI don't know.\n\nIf we're going to get back together, she's going to have to apologize and accept that I'm a grown man who can make his own decisions.\n\nThen she's going to have to convince your mother to let you go into space.\n\nObviously.\n\nI had no choice.\n\nI had to tell his mother.\n\nHe can't go to space.\n\nHe's like a baby bird.\n\nDo you know he once got an asthma attack from reading an old library book?\n\nYou're kidding.\n\nNo, I was there that day.\n\nSheldon threw his back out handing him that book.\n\nI don't know what I'm going to do.\n\nI don't want to break up over this.\n\nOkay, why don't you just tell him you made a mistake?\n\nDo you guys think it was a mistake?\n\nAm I the bad guy in this?\n\nIt's not for us to judge.\n\nWe're just here to provide comfort and support while you come to grips with what a despicable thing you've done.\n\nOh, God, you're right.\n\nI took our love and threw it under his bus-sized mother.\n\nI need to apologize.\n\nWell, that-that's good.\n\nI'm glad you came to that.\n\nBut before you do, let me just ask you a big picture question.\n\nWhat?\n\nAre you to marry Howard Wolowitz?\n\nI do, with all my heart.\n\nGot it.\n\nJust had to check.\n\nHe's great.\n\nAll right, Sheldon.\n\nWe're going to Wil's.\n\nThis is your last chance.\n\nNo, Leonard, this is <i>your</i> last chance.\n\nOne day, a historian is going to come to you and say, \"Is it true you were friends with Dr. Sheldon Cooper?\"\n\nAnd you're going to have to choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble, \"I was, but \"I chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from <i>Stand By Me</i> that no one remembers.\"\n\nYou want to drive?\n\nSure.\n\nHey, Sheldon?\n\nOh, good.

I have nothing to say.\n\nAll right.\n\nI just wanted to tell you\n\nI'm sorry I said something to your mother.\n\nI was gonna tell her eventually, but you went behind my back.\n\nI know. I'm sorry.\n\nI got scared.\n\nIf you're gonna love me, you're gonna have to love the whole package: the tenderhearted poet and the crazy daredevil.\n\nI know.\n\nWell, don't say it if you're not gonna mean it, 'cause I'm not just gonna stop with the space station.\n\nYeah, I want to go to the\n\nMoon, I want to go to Mars.\n\nI want to take a one-man sub to the lowest depths of the ocean.\n\nReally?\n\nYou got seasick on Pirates of the Caribbean.\n\nWell, those big kids were rocking it.\n\nI just did what I did because I love you so much, and the thought of losing you is more than I can handle.\n\nReally?\n\nYou're my soul mate.\n\nThis is where you kiss me.\n\nRight, right.

You know, it's been a while.\n\nI'm getting back out there.\n\nLet me ask you, when you get back out there, are you wearing this?\n\nWell, it's super cute on.\n\nThat top has paid for itself in free drinks like ten times what it cost.\n\nYes, Penny has a lot of her money tied up in promiscuity futures.\n\nHon, you think maybe the reason why you're having trouble finding a guy to settle down with is because you're letting them ride the roller coaster without buying a ticket?\n\nOh, they don't always get to ride the roller coaster.\n\nSometimes they only get to spin the teacups.\n\nNow I'm going out tonight.\n\nWould it be crazy to ask you to look at the outfit I'm going to wear?\n\nOh, not crazy at all.\n\nAnd don't beat yourself up.\n\nWhen I was your age, you could have me for a car ride and a bottle of strawberry wine.\n\nThat will not be in this week's e-mail blast.\n\nSo, this spring,\n\nI get to go to the International\n\nSpace Station.\n\nOh, my word, a trip to the heavens.\n\nIf you ever want to live there eternally,\n\nI've got a good book you could read.\n\nThanks, but I watch the\n\nCharlie Brown Christmas special every year, so I get the gist.\n\nI bet your mom is really proud of you.\n\nNope.\n\nShe says if I don't back out she's going to go on a hunger strike.\n\nIt would take years before she'd be in any kind of danger, but still.\n\nI've got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom.\n\nI'm taking you to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology.\n\nAnd the best part is, at the Q and A afterward,\n\nI've worked up a couple of \"Q's\" that will stump his sorry \"A.\"\n\nI don't know, Shelly.\n\nI thought we could do a little sightseeing.\n\nWhat sight is better than your little boy embarrassing a Nobel laureate?\n\nCome on, Sheldon, we'll take your mom to see the Hollywood sign, the wax museum, the Walk of Fame.\n\nOoh, maybe a little Rodeo Drive.\n\nWell, I can't spend $12,000 on a handbag, but it's free to look upon those who do with righteous condemnation.\n\nWhat do you say?\n\nWhat do I say?\n\nI say you people need to stop ruining my mom's visit with your sushi, and your sadness and your slutty shirts.\n\nStop it.\n\nHe's not talking about your shirt. Your shirt is fine.\n\nThese are delicious.\n\nThe trick to pancakes is bacon grease.\n\nI cook everything in it.\n\nEverything? Aren't you worried about your health?\n\nOh, doctors are always changing their mind.\n\nOne week bacon grease is bad for you.\n\nThe next week we're not getting enough of it.\n\nGood morning, Shelly.\n\nMom, I want to apologize for my behavior last night.\n\nApology accepted.\n\nGreat.\n\nNow, you're going to love the Perlmutter lecture.\n\nLook, he will be stating that the universe is older than 6,000 years, but I thought you could stick your fingers in your ears and hum \"Amazing Grace\" during those parts.\n\nI am still going out with your friends.\n\nBut I apologized.\n\nAnd that was hard for me because\n\nI didn't do anything wrong.\n\nShelly, I hung out with you in enough dusty lecture halls while you were growing up.\n\nI want to go sightseeing.\n\nSo why don't you have some pancakes, get dressed and come with us.\n\nI'm not going, and you can't make me.\n\nYou're right, I can't.\n\nHave a nice day.\n\nWell, I'm going to stand here until you change your mind.\n\nWell, then you are going to stand there all day.\n\nI'm just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there.\n\nI can't believe my own mother is abandoning me.\n\nI am not abandoning you.\n\nSheldon, abandoning you is leaving you in a basket on a church doorstep.\n\nI am going to Hollywood and thank a wax Ronald Reagan for his service to our country.\n\nWe appear to be at a crossroads in our relationship, Mother.\n\nWell, I guess we are.\n\nSorry.\n\nSyrup.\n\nAll right, Mom.\n\nWhen you're at the Ripley's\n\nBelieve It Or Not Museum, if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance to spend the day with the world's most wonderful son, believe it, because it's true.\n\nI hadn't...\n\nThat lecture was a waste of time.\n\nI made more accurate diagrams of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery wall with the contents of my diaper.\n\nAre you getting sick?\n\nNo, I'm just allergic to people who get Nobel Prizes for no good reason.\n\nSheldon, is it possible that your foul mood-- or, to use the clinical term, bitchiness-- is because your mother isn't making you a priority?\n\nNo. Or to use the clinical term, \"nuh-uh.\"\n\nAre you sure?\n\nThe infant-mother pair-bond is the building block of primate psychology.\n\nOh, there it is.\n\nIt always comes back to monkeys with you.\n\nJust monkeys, monkeys, monkeys.\n\nSheldon, we're all animals.\n\nAnd granted, there are aspects of you that are extraordinary, but when it comes to emotions and relationships, you're just like everybody else.\n\nAre you trying to suggest that my emotional problems are no different than those of a stupid person?\n\nActually, some research indicates that by not overthinking, the less intelligent handle emotions better.\n\nSure you're not coming down with a cold?\n\nOh, yes, the common cold.\n\nJust like everyone else.\n\nYou'd love that, wouldn't you?\n\nOh, this one's sweet.\n\nYou know, for your rosary rattlers.\n\nMrs. Cooper, we say \"Catholics,\" not \"rosary rattlers.\"\n\nMy goodness, it's a wonder you people in California can talk at all.\n\nThis is like the worst Hollywood tour ever.\n\nWhat are we gonna do?\n\nShe wanted to see churches.\n\nHey, they have wine here, don't they?\n\nNone of our gods have abs like that.\n\nYep, that's the last\n\nJew who did sit-ups.\n\nAnd look where it got him.\n\nHey, while we're here, why don't we all do some praying?\n\nLet's put a little church in this church.\n\nOh, I'm not sure we should...\n\nIt's easy.\n\nI'll show you how.\n\nLord, Mary Cooper here.\n\nComing to you from\n\nGomorrah, California.\n\nI want to thank you for the blessing that is my little Shelly.\n\nI also want to thank you for the continued strength not to coldcock him with my Bible.\n\nAll right, Penny, your turn.\n\nOkay, um...\n\nHey, God.\n\nWhat's up?\n\nUm, I'm good, but, uh, it would be a big help to my family if you could get my brother to stop cooking meth.\n\nBut no cops. Be cool.\n\nShe also goes a little overboard on the \"love thy neighbor.\"\n\nCould probably use that chat you had with Mary Magdalene.\n\nLeonard, you're up.\n\nWasserman, you're on deck.\n\nOkay. I don't know... it's probably a little late to ask you to make me taller.\n\nOh, um... if you could help out with me and my girlfriend.\n\nShe's all the way in India.\n\nThat would be great.\n\nHear that? Girl trouble.\n\nTurns out we were both wrong on that front.\n\nHow about you?\n\nOh, me? No.\n\nThanks, I'm good.\n\nI'm really just trying not to burst into flames.\n\nRajesh?\n\nHe says he's having trouble dropping those last five pounds.\n\nHuh, I might have gone with the talking-to-girls thing.\n\nNo, you only get one wish.\n\nLook at the two of us.\n\nMe, a highly regarded physicist.\n\nThe kind of mind that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation.\n\nYou, the common man, tired from your labors as a stockbroker, or vacuum cleaner salesman, or bootblack.\n\nBut deep down inside... apparently we're just two peas in a pod.\n\nA regular pea, and the kind of pea that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation.\n\nRain.\n\nAnother great equalizer.\n\nFalling on the head of the brilliant and the unremarkable alike.\n\nSmarty-pants.\n\nOh, Mrs. Cooper, it smells so good.\n\nYou take notes, darlin'.\n\nThe real way to get a man is with melted cheese and cream of mushroom soup.\n\nHe'll die at 50 but his love will be true.\n\nI need a tissue.\n\nThis one got wet.\n\nHere.\n\nThank you. Yeah, I've learned something today.\n\nYou and I, in so many ways, other than intelligence and what counts, we're the same.\n\nSweetheart, are you sick?\n\nI hope so, because if this is well, life isn't worth living.\n\nOh, sugarpie, you are burning up.\n\nWe've got to get you to bed.\n\nOkay.\n\nDon't worry. Mama's here to take care of her baby.\n\nAnd just to be clear, only her baby and not these other people.\n\nOf course.\n\nCan I have tea with honey and toast with the crust cut off?\n\nYou can have whatever you want.\n\nThanks, Mom.\n\nYou're the best.\n\nBoy, last time I put\n\nVapoRub on you, you didn't have hair on your chest.\n\nI know, it filled in last year.\n\nI didn't get to spend a lot of time with you on this visit.\n\nAnd whose fault was that?\n\nYours.\n\nShelly, you're not eight years old anymore.\n\nWe have to have a different relationship.\n\nNo, we don't.\n\nThe one we have works great.\n\nSweetheart, you are a grown man.\n\nOr maybe I'm part of a new species, that lives for hundreds of years, which means I'm still basically a toddler.\n\nOh, I so should have taken you to Houston.\n\nDoes this mean you're not going to sing \"Soft Kitty\"?\n\nNo, I will always sing you \"Soft Kitty.\" ** Soft kitty, warm kitty ** ** Little ball of fur... **\n\nMrs. Cooper, were we supposed to take that pie out of the oven?\n\nGet out!\n\nWell, that was rude.\n\nWell, I know, but he means well.\n\nSing. ** Happy kitty, sleepy kitty... **\n\nWhat are you trying to pull, Mom?\n\nFrom the top.\n\nThis is what I'm talking about. ** Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur... **\n\nSubtitulos.es == DIFUNDE LA PALABRA ==\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "8e6bf95c-6ca5-44f0-a6ad-d9d807113001": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e6bf95c-6ca5-44f0-a6ad-d9d807113001", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "550d302f3ab612a29a770fa70004e139512c8653dd108774a07b2efed7f84bda", "text": "  \ufeff1\n\nAnd reverse the spin on the antiproton... and gamma becomes alpha...\n\nMultiplied by a matrix of negative I comma zero...\n\nAnd there we have it.\n\nConclusive proof that I am absolutely worthless after 9:00.\n\nCREEPY VOICE:\n\nSheldon...\n\nSheldon...\n\nHmm.\n\nAll right, all right.\n\nI see what's going on.\n\nA little pre-Halloween hijinkery. cackling)\n\nA ghostly moan, a rattling of chains, a witch's cackle.\n\nThe trifecta of haunted house clich\u00e9s.\n\nInstead of \"Eek,\"\n\nI say, \"Yawn.\"\n\nCREEPY VOICE:\n\nSheldon...\n\nOh, the walls are dripping blood, which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator exposed to a sodium carbonate solution. \"See you in hell Sheldon.\"\n\nThe most frightening thing about that is the missing comma.\n\nAh.\n\nOkay, all right.\n\nThat one was clever.\n\nSkeleton with phosphorous on a zip line.\n\nCome on out, merry pranksters.\n\nTake a bow.\n\nYou should've seen your face.\n\nYes, there's nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes of mildly startled.\n\nCome on, admit it.\n\nWe got you, Sheldon.\n\nPlease, fright depends on an element of surprise.\n\nThe simple fact is, because I am much smarter than you, and able to anticipate your actions, it is highly unlikely that you two rubes could ever surprise me.\n\nHe's probably right.\n\nWe can't beat him.\n\nHe's just too smart.\n\nGentlemen.\n\nWho had money on \"faints\"?\n\nI had \"pee his pants.\"\n\nHang on.\n\nLooks like everyone's a winner. \u266a Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \u266a \u266a Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started...

You wouldn't understand.\n\nHey, well, see you.\n\nI'm going out.\n\nI thought you were leaving the apartment.\n\nYeah, me, too.\n\nI can't make up my mind.\n\nAre you concerned because the world is filled with big dogs and bullies?\n\nNo. I'm having a moral crisis.\n\nWell, if it's of any help, I've read all the great moral philosophers, including Dr. Seuss.\n\nOh, what the hell.\n\nI'm supposed to go see that girl from the comic book store,\n\nAlice, but I don't know if I should, because\n\nI'm going out with Priya, but she's in India.\n\nAll right. So the topic at hand is sexual fidelity.\n\nProbably won't be relying on Seuss here.\n\nAlthough <i>One Fish, Two Fish,</i> might be surprisingly applicable.\n\nGo on.\n\nWell... they say at the end of your life, you regret the stuff you didn't do more than the stuff that you did, and I'm pretty sure Alice is the stuff I want to do.\n\nYou know, the German philosopher,\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche, believed that morality is just a fiction used by the herd of inferior human beings to hold back the few superior men.\n\nThat actually does help.\n\nIt's worth noting that he died of syphilis.\n\nScrew it,\n\nI'm going.\n\nOn your way home, will you pick up some orange juice?\n\nDo you mind?\n\nI'm questioning a lot of things in my life right now.\n\nIs one of those things your fondness for orange juice?\n\nNo.\n\nGreat. Tropicana, no pulp.\n\nHey, Sheldon.\n\nWho is it!\n\nIt's me, Sheldon, Mrs. Wolowitz.\n\nThat's not my mom, it's Bernadette.\n\nReally?\n\nThat's very unsettling.\n\nHi, Sheldon.\n\nHi.\n\nWhat's up?\n\nIt just occurred to me that I never formally congratulated you on your pending nuptials.\n\nSo I hopped on the first bus and hightailed it down here to shake your hand.\n\nPut 'er there, you old so-and-so.\n\nWell, I-I'm gonna see you at work in... could have waited until then?\n\nHoly smoke, why didn't I think of that?\n\nYou're a better man than I, Howard Wolowitz.\n\nYou put 'er there, you son of a gun!\n\nWhatever.\n\nMy... oh... it's...\n\nOh, my God, Howard!\n\nWhat did you do?\n\nIt was a harmless\n\nHalloween prank. Look.\n\nHoward has a heart condition!\n\nYou know that!\n\nWell, I thought he made that up.\n\nI-Isn't hypochondria a common idiosyncrasy of Jewish people?\n\nThis is adrenaline-- we're gonna have to inject it into his heart.\n\nWe are?\n\nYou are.

Your gal pals,\n\nPenny and Bernadette, went out shopping for some wedding nonsense without Amy, an action they took with no thought or regard as to how it would affect me, the future of string theory or my Lego fun time!\n\nWhat do you want <i>us</i> to do about it?\n\nYou clearly weren't listening to my topic sentence:\n\nGet your women in line!\n\nYou make them apologize to Amy and set things right.\n\nI am a man of science, not someone's snuggle bunny!\n\nWhy do I have to talk to Penny?\n\nShe's not my girlfriend.\n\nYou invited her to lunch four years ago.\n\nEverything about her is on you; you make it so!\n\nMoo-shu is Penny.\n\nThank you.\n\nWhere's Sheldon?\n\nHe was up late last night, so I gave him an early dinner and put him to bed.\n\nThat's so sweet.\n\nYeah, but now he's gonna be up at dawn and want to play.\n\nSo, listen, guys, the reason he was up late is because he was taking care of Amy.\n\nShe's kind of upset.\n\nWhy?\n\nHer feelings got hurt because you guys went dress shopping without her.\n\nI told you that would happen.\n\nOkay, look, this is her first time being a bridesmaid and she's just getting a little crazy with it.\n\nShe keeps on telling us stories about bridesmaid traditions in other cultures, and they're all about getting naked and washing each other.\n\nYeah, and she keeps trying to figure out if our cycles have synced up so we can call ourselves \"The Three Menstra-Teers\"\"\n\nWe thought it would be easier to look at dresses one time without her.\n\nI feel terrible.\n\nI know. Me, too.\n\nWe'll talk to her.\n\nHey, wait, how did she find out?\n\nRaj did it.\n\nAnd he says he would do it again.\n\nHey, I'm sorry.\n\nYou sent me the picture;\n\nI wasn't thinking.\n\nOh, Howie.\n\nWell, hey, I'm usually pretty good at not blabbing.\n\nYou tell me tons of stuff about these guys, and I never repeat it.\n\nWhat do you tell him?\n\nOh, you know, just pillow talk.\n\nYou guys have nothing to worry about.\n\nHold on, did you talk about us when we were dating?\n\nNo. All your little secrets are fine.\n\nYes, absolutely fine.\n\nI'll tell you later.\n\nCome on, tumor.\n\nCome on, tumor, Mama needs an aggressive little glioblastoma.\n\nYay, brain tumor!\n\nProbably not the same reaction you had when <i>you</i> got the news.\n\nHi.\n\nHello.\n\nWhat are you doing here?\n\nWell, look, we just wanted to apologize for not bringing you with us the other day.\n\nThat's not necessary-- it's like <i>Sesame Street</i> says: \"One of these things is not like the other, one of these things should die alone.\"\n\nCome on, Amy, let us make it up to you.\n\nWe'll have a girl's night; we'll do whatever you want.\n\nWe can go down to the Korean baths and do that thing you were talking about where we wash each other.\n\nWith-with loofah mitts, no hands.\n\nIt's okay.\n\nI'm glad this happened.\n\nI can stop pretending that some beautiful girl and her cute-in- the-right-light friend want to hang out with me.\n\nAmy, we're really sorry.\n\nYeah, we feel awful.\n\nDon't. I'll be okay.\n\nYou're not the first girls\n\nI thought were friends with me who ended up shunning me.\n\nIt's like elementary school, junior high, high school, undergrad, grad school, and that semester abroad in Norway all over again.\n\nOh, come on, Amy.\n\nYou don't get it.\n\nLook at this brain.\n\nI don't really want to.\n\nThis is us.\n\nBernadette, you are the analytical, scientific left hemisphere.\n\nPenny, you're the creative, spontaneous right hemisphere.\n\nAnd where's Amy?\n\nShe's right here-- the sad little tumor no one wants to go dress shopping with.\n\nAmy, you're not a tumor.\n\nPenny, tell her she's not a tumor.\n\nDid you know that when\n\nAlexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, he proposed answering it with \"ahoy\"?\n\nAhoy.\n\nI like it.\n\nAmy? Is that you?\n\nHave you been drinking?\n\nI'm sorry, I bet my sweet what?\n\nWell, all right.\n\nWe're on our way.\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nIt would seem Amy is drunk in a liquor store parking lot.\n\nReally?

Sheldon, what would it take for you to go into that liquor store, buy a bottle of hooch, take me across the street to that motel, and have your way with me?\n\nYeah, Sheldon, what would it take?\n\nI'm begging both of you, please, let's go.\n\nOkay.\n\nCome on.\n\nUpsy-daisy.\n\nWhee!\n\nOoh, finally someone found second base.\n\nI know how you feel.\n\nI got a knife slicing through my frontal lobe, too.\n\nHi.\n\nWhat do you want?\n\nDo you want me to give the friendship bracelet back?\n\nI never gave you a friendship bracelet.\n\nWhen we first met, I made one and pretended you gave it to me.\n\nYou can have it back if you want.\n\nNo, you made that for you;\n\nI want <i>you</i> to have it.\n\nWe know you're upset, and you have every right to be, but if it's okay with you, we'd like a second chance to make things right.\n\nWe are really sorry, and we were trying to think of some way to show you how much we care about you.\n\nWhich is why it would mean so much if you would agree to be the maid of honor at my wedding.\n\nWhat? Wait, is this some kind of practical joke?\n\nLike in Norway, when my \"friends\" trapped me in a sauna with a horny otter?\n\nNo. I-I want you to be the maid of honor.\n\nOh, my gosh.\n\nNo one's every asked me to be the maid of honor before.\n\nWell, that's not true.\n\nOnce, but then they all died.\n\nSo is that a yes?\n\nYes. Yes.\n\nOh, my gosh,\n\nI-I have so much to do.\n\nThere's the bridal shower and the bachelorette party.\n\nWhat should we do for the bachelorette party?\n\nOh, I know-- we'll go to a Native American sweat lodge, we'll take peyote, roll around in the mud, and paint fertility symbols on Bernadette's naked body.\n\nSo that's happening.\n\nYeah, sure, sure.\n\nVegas is fun, too.\n\nI feel like crying.\n\nOf course, I could just be hormonal.\n\nOh, wait. Maybe our menses are finally syncing up. Bernadette?\n\nNo? Penny?\n\nSorry.\n\nReally?\n\nOkay, yeah.\n\nYay!\n\nMaid of honor\n\nAmy Farrah Fowler's amazing behind-the-scenes wedding video, take one.\n\nWe're just trying on dresses-- do we really need to record this?\n\nI'm sorry, are <i>you</i> the maid of honor?\n\nI <i>am</i> the bride.\n\nSo no.

Spoiler alert.\n\nAll right, fine.\n\nThanks.\n\nTickets are 11 bucks.\n\nNot a date.\n\nCome on, Sheldon,\n\nStar Wars.\n\nI'm pushing play.\n\nI mean it.\n\nIf we don't start soon,\n\nGeorge Lucas is going to change it again.\n\nThis would go a lot faster if you put your trade school diploma to work and helped me set up this high frequency tone generator.\n\nI have a Masters degree from M.I.T.\n\nYeah, but you've got a can- attitude and that's what's important.\n\nI really don't get your problem with birds.\n\nThe question you should be asking is what is their problem with me?\n\nMy first memory: A hummingbird dive-bombing my stroller to get at the apple juice in my sippy cup.\n\nHummingbirds are pretty.\n\nHummingbirds are the vampires of the flower world.\n\nStill my first choice for an ankle tattoo.\n\nOr a dolphin--\n\nI go back and forth.\n\nAge seven, a blood-thirsty chicken chases me up a tree.\n\nAge 12, a magpie tries to steal the retainer out of my mouth.\n\nAge 16, a parrot in a pet store called me fat ass.\n\nNeed I go on?\n\nYes, please. This is way better than the movie.\n\nAll right, Sheldon, your bird death ray is ready.\n\nIt's not a death ray.\n\nIt's just a little ultrasonic blast to scare him off.\n\nTrust me, if I had a death ray,\n\nI wouldn't be living here.\n\nI'd be in my lair enjoying the money the people of Earth gave me for not using my death ray.\n\nAll right, and in three, two, one.\n\nThat is one tough birdie.\n\nCome on, you enjoyed the movie.\n\nI saw you tearing up when the village got flooded, and everyone had to relocate.\n\nNo, I was thinking how come they get to leave and I can't.\n\nI'm going to get some fries.\n\nYou want anything?\n\nUh, no, thanks.\n\nAre you sure?\n\nYou always say no, and then you eat half my fries.\n\nI just eat the little crispy ones you don't like.\n\nNo, I love them.\n\nI save them for the end, but they're gone because you ate them.\n\nAnd why did\n\nI let you eat them?\n\nTo get sex.\n\nExactly.\n\nBut this is not a date.\n\nSo I ask again, would you like anything?\n\nAll right, I'd like an order ofries.\n\nGreat. That'll be five dollars.\n\nI am having the best time.\n\nI'm so glad you suggested we do this.\n\nOh, sorry.\n\nNo problem.\n\nWhat you writing there?\n\nA screenplay.\n\nIts about a guy whose roommate is having sex and tells him  go to a bar and work on his screenplay. \"I Hope Alex Gets Crabs:\n\nThe Movie.\"\n\nIt's a working title.\n\nOh.\n\nI'm Kevin.\n\nOh. Penny.\n\nNice to meet you.\n\nI'll let you get back to your date.\n\nOh, no, no.\n\nThis isn't a date, no.\n\nRight?\n\nUh... right.\n\nSo have you written anything\n\nI might have seen?\n\nThat depends. How much time do you spend on Yelp?\n\nThis is ridiculous.\n\nI'm a grown man from Texas.\n\nThis isn't a terrifying bird like a swan or a goose.\n\nIt's just a blue jay.\n\nThat's a pretty big blue jay.\n\nOne... two... three.\n\nGo! Shoo!\n\nAm-scray, ird-bay!\n\nBird in the apartment!\n\nBird in the apartment!\n\nNo!\n\nSo it is an amazing documentary.\n\nThey need the electricity from the dam, but at the same time, they want to preserve the environment.\n\nYou're kidding me.\n\nUh, can I see you for a sec over here?\n\nOh, yeah. Sure.\n\nJust one sec?\n\nNo problem.\n\nWhat's up?\n\nI know what you're doing.\n\nWhat am I doing?\n\nYou're going out of your way to talk to that guy because\n\nI said we weren't on a date.\n\nNo, I'm talking to him because he's cute.\n\nCome on, he's not that cute.\n\nYes, he is.\n\nWith his dorky T-shirt and his little hipster glasses.\n\nI wear dorky T-shirts and glasses.\n\nYes, but when you're tall and have great cheekbones, you're doing it ironically.\n\nIf that's so, what if I start talking to a girl?\n\nYou should!\n\nI'm serious.\n\nI'll do it.\n\nGood! Go! There are some girls right over there.\n\nWhat are you waiting for?\n\nThey're in a group.\n\nI'm scared.\n\nSheldon, what do you expect us to do?\n\nYou're biologists.\n\nBiology is the study of living things.\n\nThat's a living thing; get cracking.\n\nI specialize in microorganisms, and Amy studies brains.\n\nYeah, neither of us minored in bird-shooing.\n\nOh, come now.\n\nYour undergraduate work must have included a varmints and critters class.\n\nCome back in, Sheldon, he's not going to hurt you.\n\nHe looks friendly.\n\nI think he might be someone's pet.\n\nNo, Bernadette, don't be a hero!\n\nOh, he's a sweetie.\n\nYes. It's very sweet.\n\nNow, slowly and carefully, flush him down the toilet.\n\nSheldon, the only way to get past this fear is to interact with it.\n\nJust like you did with the mailman.\n\nEvery year tens of people around the world are killed by birds.\n\nI'm not going to be another statistic.\n\nLook how sweet he is.\n\nCome over and say .\n\nCome on.\n\nYou can do it.\n\nDon't be scared.\n\nCome on.\n\nOh, just pet the bird, you big baby!\n\nI did it!\n\nI actually did it.\n\nOkay, now flush him.\n\nSo, Leonard, what do you do for fun?\n\nI'm... let's see.\n\nHiking.\n\nKaraoke in Koreatown.\n\nAny Jennifer Aniston movie.\n\nHey. Sorry I ditched you.\n\nNo, it's fine.\n\nYou can ditch away.\n\nOh, no, no.\n\nWe said we were going to hang out, let's hang out.\n\nIt's cool.\n\nGo back to Kevin.\n\nOh, he had to leave.\n\nInteresting.\n\nSo now that he's gone, you want to hang out with me.\n\nThis must be Penny.\n\nYep.\n\nI totally get it.\n\nHuh? I'm sorry, get what?\n\nDon't worry about it. You know, there's some guys over there.\n\nYou should go talk to them.\n\nNo, no. I want to know what you told her.\n\nThat's kind of between me and...\n\nLaura.\n\nLaura.\n\nOh. Okay, I see.\n\nSo while he was telling you things, did he mention he owns not one, but two Star Trek uniforms?\n\nReally?\n\nYeah. Wears them.\n\nNot just for Halloween.\n\nHey, pal.\n\nYou didn't see me telling\n\nKevin that you thought cold wars were only fought in winter.\n\nOkay. Then I'll return the favor, and I won't tell...\n\nLaura. ...Laura that half the dirty movies you own are animated.\n\nWhen you were telling Kevin about your acting career, did you mention your long-running role as \"Waitress\" in a local production of\n\nThe Cheesecake Factory?\n\nDid you tell her about your lucky asthma inhaler?\n\nOh, yeah? Spell \"asthma.\"\n\nA-s...\n\nTake me home.\n\nMaybe I'm not done hanging out with...\n\nYou're right, it's getting late.\n\nIt's remarkable.\n\nAll that time spent in fear.\n\nAnd for what?\n\nHe's magnificent.\n\nOh, dear.\n\nI just realized I haven't offered you a beverage.\n\nOh, it's just like my grandma with her parrot.\n\nAnd after she lost her marbles with her remote control.\n\nMy phone's on the desk over there.\n\nTake a picture of us together.\n\nMake it good enough to go on a mug, a mouse pad, and a calendar.\n\nIf you were a dove,\n\nI'd call you Lovey-Dovey.\n\nOh. Who am I kidding?\n\nThis isn't a moment for strict adherence to the literal.\n\nYou're just my little\n\nLovey-Dovey, aren't you?\n\nGuess you gotta have hollow bones to get some sugar around here.\n\nI still think he looks like someone's pet.\n\nMaybe we should put up posters.\n\nYes. It should have a big picture of him, and the words, \"Is this your bird? Not anymore.\"\n\nWe're going to have so much fun together.\n\nYou can carry messages to all my enemies.\n\nI can tie a string to your leg and fly you like a kite.\n\nIf you're keeping him,\n\nI've got a cage you can borrow.\n\nOne of the test monkeys slipped on a banana peel and broke his neck.\n\nIt was both tragic and hysterical.\n\nNonsense.\n\nNo. Lovey-Dovey doesn't sleep in a cage.\n\nNo. Lovey-Dovey sleeps in his very own nest, which I'm going to get off the windowsill and put in my room.\n\nIsn't that right, LD?\n\nNo.\n\nWhere are you going?\n\nCome back, Lovey-Dovey!\n\nThis is your home now!\n\nI already ordered 20 pounds of bird feed off of Amazon!\n\nHe's gone.\n\nI'm sorry, Sheldon.\n\nHow could he do this to me?\n\nGet back here, you stupid bird, so I can love you!\n\nOkay. So... we went out, saw a movie, met some nice people, said horrible things about each other in public... all in all, a pretty magical night.\n\nOkay, I'm not innocent in all this, but you basically called me stupid, you asthmatic dumbass.\n\nI know, I-I-I crossed a line.\n\nAnd I'm sorry.\n\nNono, no, hang on.\n\nI really mean it.\n\nAnd it's not like when we were going out, I'd just apologize for everything so we could end up in be\n\nThis is a 100% sex-is-off-the-table \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nI'm sorry, too.\n\nJust to be clear, sex is off the table, right?\n\nWay off.\n\nMaybe we're not ready to hang out as friends.\n\nI don't know.\n\nUp until the last part,\n\nI was kind of enjoying take-charge Leonard with a little backbone.\n\nPicking the movie, knowing what he wants, a little cocky.\n\nReally?\n\nYeah.\n\nWell, then, I'm putting sex back on the table.\n\nWhat do you think about that?\n\nOoh. Maybe I like it.\n\nYou do? Because if that's what you like, I can be that guy.\n\nI swear, I'll be anything you want me to be.\n\nGood night, Leonard.\n\nI am such an asthmatic dumbass.\n\nI had a weird night.\n\nMine w great.\n\nI'm going to be a mommy. visit tvshowslatest.blogspot.com\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "09be7599-8b85-4253-9ddf-71e1131b51c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "09be7599-8b85-4253-9ddf-71e1131b51c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "de70c92ab9460ca47b4fc0683dd3210b4136aa808a9ceb159ff3c241560b2cf1", "text": "  \ufeff1\n\nIt's amazing people keep coming visit tvshowslatest.blogspot.com to comic book stores instead of just downloading comics digitally.\n\nIt's probably for the best.\n\nFor a lot of these guys, the weekly trip here is the only chance their mom has to go down to the basement and change their sheets.\n\nOh, that reminds me,\n\nI get fresh sheets tonight.

I mean, you are gonna be a mom someday, right?\n\nMmm...\n\nYeah, sure.\n\nOh-ho-ho!\n\nI haven't seen this trick in years.\n\nIt's called the dove pan.\n\nYou let everyone see the pan is empty, but there's a secret compartment in the lid.\n\nAnd then you open it and produce a live...\n\nDon't look in there.\n\nOh, a little Red\n\nDead Redemption, huh?\n\nSHELDON:\n\nYes.\n\nHow come you're not doing a mission?\n\nYou're just wandering around.\n\nHad a rough night.\n\nI thought I'd go for a walk and clear my head.\n\nSome people go outside and do that.\n\nIt's after 9:00-- at this hour the streets of Pasadena are teeming with drunken sailors and alley cats.\n\nYou want to talk about it?\n\nNo.\n\nI think I'll just go in this saloon and drink my troubles away.\n\nYou know digital alcohol is never a solution.\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nHard as this may be to believe, it's possible that\n\nI'm not boyfriend material.\n\nGlad I was sitting down for that.\n\nDid you and Amy get in a fight?\n\nAmy had a fight; I was being perfectly reasonable.\n\nI'm gonna have a whiskey.\n\nDo you want anything?\n\nNo, I can't.\n\nI'm playing Grand\n\nTheft Auto later.\n\nLook, I'm no expert in women...\n\nI'll say.\n\nThat's not necessary when someone's trying to help you.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nIt's the alcohol talking.\n\nGo on.\n\nSometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them and then show them that you can grow and change.\n\nNuts to that.\n\nWhat else you got?\n\nBuy her something.\n\nHow does that work?\n\nWell, you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture.\n\nWell, that approach has Sheldon\n\nCooper written all over it.\n\nGlad I could help.\n\nIt's appreciated.\n\nAnd if you ever manage to find a woman again, I'll be glad to return the favor.\n\nAnd now, all the rings are magically linked together.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e's wearing a magic ring, too.\n\nIt made all my money disappear.\n\nOh, ah, right.\n\nAnd now, the great Howdini's next miraculous illusion.\n\nWhen are we gonna have cake?\n\nAfter you've been thoroughly amazed.\n\nBut we want cake now.\n\nWell, you're not getting cake right now, <i>capisce?</i>\n\nOkay. Okay.\n\nNow, my lovely assistant is going to bring me an ordinary pitcher of milk.\n\nI know how you do that trick.\n\nDo you know how to pipe down?\n\nOkay, we're going to roll up this newspaper.\n\nIt's a fake pitcher.\n\nYou got wax in your ears?\n\nThe man said it's an ordinary pitcher.\n\nHowdini.\n\nOkay, we're going to stick this in here.\n\nAnd then I'm going to pour in the milk.\n\nI hope this works, because I didn't bring a change of pants.\n\nLook, I Googled it.\n\nIt's a fake pitcher.\n\nThat's it.\n\nNo cake for you.\n\nAnyone else want to join the No Cake Club?\n\nShe's just kidding, boys and girls.\n\nEveryone gets cake.\n\nNot him.\n\nJust give me the pitcher.\n\nBehold!\n\nWrong pitcher.\n\nI told you I'm not good with kids.\n\nYes, you did.\n\nOh, I think my crotch is starting to curdle.\n\nThe thing is, my mother worked full-time.\n\nI had to take care of my brothers and sisters.\n\nYeah, so?\n\nUgh, it was horrible!\n\nWith their snotty noses and their poopy diapers and their little shrieky voices, always complaining. \"I don't want to get dressed.\" \"Joey keeps spitting in my mouth.\" \"This isn't the way\n\nMom makes waffles.\" hand in here.\n\nLet's see how you like this waffle!\n\nAll right, settle down.\n\nRed light.\n\nRed light, red light!\n\nOkay, we're fine.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nI know it makes me sound like a bad person, but I just don't like children.\n\nYeah, no, we all got that.\n\nBut don't you think it'll be different when the child is ours?\n\nRight, when it's our kid that's ruined my body and kept me up all night and\n\nI've got no career and no future and nothing to be happy about for the next 20 years, sure, that'll be completely different.\n\nWell, yeah.\n\nI don't think there's anything in this jewelry store that Amy would appreciate more than the humidifier we were just looking at at Sears.\n\nOh, my God, now I know what I sound like to you when I say stupid stuff.\n\nOoh, a pocket watch.\n\nOkay, I don't think Amy wants a pocket watch.\n\nNo, but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch.\n\nStill saying stupid stuff.\n\nOoh...\n\nDoes she like bracelets?\n\nWell, she's very fond of her silver one that says \"allergic to penicillin.\"\n\nMaybe they have a dressier version of that?\n\nWell, how are we doing this afternoon?\n\nAre we looking for anything special?\n\nPerhaps a ring for the lady? not a couple.\n\nExcuse me.\n\nI don't see why you get to snort derisively and point that out.\n\nYou'd be lucky to land a fella like me.\n\nFine, go ahead. not a couple.\n\nMy apologies.\n\nHow can I help you today?\n\nHe's in trouble with his girlfriend and needs to buy her a present.\n\nGreat, trouble with girlfriends is what's putting my daughter through USC.\n\nOoh, are these real diamonds?\n\nYes. Channel set baguettes,\n\nRemarkable.\n\nDiamonds, crystallized carbon.\n\nEvery day, people go to the grocery store and come home with sacks full of carbon in the form of charcoal briquettes that they toss in their barbeques and set on fire.\n\nBut just because you've got some carbon with the atoms stacked neatly, you expect me to plunk down thousands of dollars.\n\nActually, that's only 750.\n\nEverything's on sale.\n\nReally. Talk to me about that pocket watch.\n\nI'm still trying to wrap my mind around it.\n\nI always thought I'd be a dad someday.\n\nOh, me, too.\n\nYou're so caring.\n\nI've often pictured you guiding a young boy into manhood.\n\nThere you go, Howard.\n\nSounds like Raj'll have your babies; problem solved.\n\nHey, just because a man shows caring for another man doesn't mean he's displaying the love that dare not speak its name.\n\nDid she definitely say she didn't want kids?\n\nYeah, she doesn't like them.\n\nAnd from what I saw, the feeling was mutual.\n\nWhat are you gonna do?\n\nI don't know.\n\nI can't see a life where I don't have kids.\n\nI mean, people have kids.\n\nI mean, even Donkey Kong had Donkey Kong Jr.\n\nSo he could teach someone how to kidnap princesses and throw barrels at Italian plumbers.\n\nYou know, there's no guarantee even if you have kids that you're going to like them.\n\nWow, that's rough.\n\nWhere'd you get that?\n\nIt's right off the dust jacket of my mom's last book.\n\nMaybe me and Bernadette aren't right for each other.\n\nLook, Howard, I'd say there's a lot of fish in the sea, but I watched you dangle your hook in the water for years.\n\nDo not throw her back.\n\nI don't want to, but this is kind of a deal breaker.\n\nWhat's your mom going to say if you call off the wedding?\n\nOh, it'll kill her.\n\nOn the other hand, if I don't give her grandchildren, that'll kill her, too.\n\nSo, either way, on the Mom front, I'm golden.\n\nWhat time did you tell\n\nAmy to be here?\n\nSheldon, that pocket watch is ridiculous.\n\nNonsense.\n\nI look like a train conductor.\n\nUnder what pretext did you lure her here? to come over and hang out?\"\n\nGood, good, if you had said something clever, she might've gotten suspicious.\n\nHey.\n\nHi.\n\nWhat's he doing here?\n\nOkay, he wants to talk to you.\n\nWell, I don't want to talk to him.\n\nAnd I'm pretty disappointed in you, too.\n\nAlthough we both know that won't last.\n\nSheldon, you're up.\n\nThank you.\n\nAmy, I'd like to apologize.\n\nYour accomplishment was impressive.\n\nAnd I'm proud of you.\n\nWe both know that's your koala face.\n\nI told you.\n\nOkay, look, he bought you this.\n\nJewelry?\n\nSeriously?\n\nSheldon, you are the most shallow, self-centered person\n\nI have ever met.\n\nDo you really think another transparently manipul...\n\nOh, it's a tiara!\n\nA tiara!\n\nI have a tiara!\n\nPut it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me.\n\nYou look beautiful.\n\nOf course I do, I'm a princess, and this is my tiara!\n\nYou were right, the tiara was too much.\n\nMRS. WOLOWITZ:\n\nHoward! Bernadette's...\n\nOh, she slipped right by me.\n\nHere's your vest back.\n\nYou should keep it.\n\nYou could wear it again sometime.\n\nWhere?\n\nI don't know, hunting?\n\nMRS. WOLOWITZ:\n\nDon't forget to talk to her about this <i>mishegas</i> where I don't get grandkids!\n\nDon't worry, Ma.\n\nI will, as soon as I can figure out a way to bring up such a sensitive issue!\n\nI guess you talked to your mom, huh?\n\nI was upset.\n\nMy mom can be a pretty good shoulder to cry on, if the smell of Bengay doesn't burn your eyes.\n\nLook, it's obvious having kids is really important to you, and I think I came up with a solution.\n\nReally?\n\nThat's great. What?\n\nWell, seeing as how I make way more money than you anyway, what if I work and you stay home with the kids?\n\nMe?\n\nYeah.\n\nYou know, you'll watch <i>Barney</i> and pull Cheerios out of their noses and go on play dates, and I'll work and have conversations with people my own age and enjoy my life.\n\nYeah...\n\nYay, so we're good.\n\nYeah, we're good.\n\nYou know, I don't know if this counted as a fight, but how about some make-up sex?\n\nI would love that.\n\nBut what is that behind your ear?\n\nOh, look, it's a condom. == sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> == visit tvshowslatest.blogspot.com\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "6078db1e-4401-4045-aba4-2ab394fe7eec": {"__data__": {"id_": "6078db1e-4401-4045-aba4-2ab394fe7eec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "a186ec1a48aac4523d1270f220b2bd5f87ee999c7f5ce0b5be27f571b81df5c2", "text": "\n\nYou feel like trying something new for dinner?\n\nMaybe Indian, Tex-Mex?\n\nYou ever wonder how humans would be different if they evolved from lizards instead of mammals?\n\nOkay, let's talk about that.\n\nAs you know, lizards-- cold-blooded animals-- lack the ability to sense temperature.\n\nBut they do move more sluggishly when it's cold.\n\nSo, lizard weathermen would say things like, \"Bring a sweater, it's slow outside.\"\n\nI love my mind.\n\nWe all do.\n\nNow, how about dinner?\n\nOh, I would assume we'd enjoy insects or smaller lizards.\n\nWe could also pull each other's tails off and grill them; they'll just grow back.\n\nOh!\n\nMy life-size cardboard\n\nMr. Spock is here!\n\nI know he wouldn't care for an outburst of human emotion, but, oh, goodie, oh, goodie, oh, goodie.\n\nCommander Spock requesting permission to be unfolded.\n\nExcuse me.\n\nPermission granted, Commander.\n\nWhich is why the more intelligent the monkey, the more feces they fling.\n\nExcuse me, Amy.\n\nPenny, do you have plans for dinner tonight?\n\nWhy, you guys going somewhere?\n\nNo, I mean just you and me.\n\nYou mean, like a date?\n\nNot like a date, a date.\n\nOoh...!\n\nOoh...!\n\nUm... o-okay.\n\nSure.\n\nOoh...!\n\nOoh...!\n\nSHELDON:\n\nOh, no!\n\nThey sent the wrong Spock!\n\nLive long and suck it,\n\nZachary Quinto.\n\nOriginal Air Date on January 19, 2012 == sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==\n\nThis is so exciting.\n\nIf Leonard and Penny get back together,\n\nHoward and I can go on double dates with them.\n\nHow come you never invite\n\nSheldon and me on a double date?\n\nMm, uh...\n\nHow's it going in there, Penny?!\n\nPENNY:\n\nJust a sec.\n\nToo much?\n\nYes.\n\nNo.\n\nOkay, just hang on.\n\nYou just can't handle her raw sexuality, can you?\n\nWhen did you and Leonard break up?\n\nUh, about two years ago.\n\nWhy do you think he asked you out again?\n\nI don't know.\n\nMaybe he's dying.\n\nThat would be so romantic.\n\nHe's not dying.\n\nToo bad.\n\nIf he were, she could just throw him in bed and ride him right up until he flatlines.\n\nHow about this?\n\nMaybe.\n\nCome on.\n\nYeah, okay, no.\n\nDo you think you'll sleep with him tonight?\n\nPENNY:\n\nAbsolutely not.\n\nLook, we're just gonna have dinner and, you know, see how it goes.\n\nIf he were dying, would you sleep with him?\n\nWhat?!\n\nAssuming he were dying of something that couldn't be sexually transmitted.\n\nYou know, like a spear wound to the head.\n\nOkay, he is not dying.\n\nHow do you know?\n\nAre you a doctor?\n\nYou can make-believe, though.\n\nSometimes Howard and I pretend that his arrhythmia is acting up and I'm a sexy cardiologist.\n\nAnd the naughty part is\n\nI'm not in his HMO network.\n\nScrew it.

Can they?\n\nOh, God, no.\n\nThe money's pretty good.\n\nAnd I used the equipment to make my own Bat-signal.\n\nBat-signal?\n\nWhat are you, some kind of nerd?\n\nNot some kind of nerd,\n\nI'm the king of the nerds.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nUh, it means if anyone displeases me,\n\nI don't help them set up their printer.\n\nYou are so funny.\n\nGood.\n\nRemember that when I take my shirt off.\n\nLeonard, this is nice.\n\nI'm so glad we did this.\n\nMe, too.\n\nSo what do you think?\n\nAre we gonna get back together?\n\nWhoa. Not so fast.\n\nI'm sorry, what did I say?\n\nLeonard, you know I will always have feelings for you.\n\nOh, God.\n\nWhat?\n\nYou said \"always.\"\n\nYou'll always have feelings for me.\n\nSo?\n\nSo, that sounds more like if you didn't want</i> a relationship with someone. \"This isn't working out, but I'll always have feelings for you.\" \"I'm sorry I slept with your best friend, but I'll always have feelings for you.\" \"Here's the thing, Lisa,\n\nI'm into dudes now, but I'll always have feelings for you.\"\n\nHow would you say it?\n\nI have feelings for you.\n\nIt's the same thing.\n\nNo, it's not. \"Always\" made it worse.\n\nYou're overthinking this.\n\nNo, I'm not.\n\nYes, you are.\n\nYou always overthink things.\n\nTh-There you go. \"Always\" made it worse.\n\nSee, this is where everything goes wrong: when we talk.\n\nWell, I don't know how you have a relationship without talking.\n\nHey, I went out with this guy TJ for eight months, we never talked.\n\nTo this day, I don't even know what TJ stands for.\n\nWait, if you guys didn't talk, what--\n\nNever mind, stupid question.\n\nAnd now that I have some wood,\n\nI'm going to begin the erection of my settlement.\n\nHe's got to be doing this on purpose.\n\nOoh, 8:30.\n\nYou and Penny decide to go out and paint the town beige?\n\nYou're 30 years old and you live with your mother.\n\nI guess it didn't go well.\n\nWe don't know that.\n\nNot to a certainty.\n\nAll we know is that Leonard is home.\n\nHow about now?\n\nAgain, not enough evidence.\n\nFor all we know, he's being murdered.\n\nNow, back to our game.\n\nYou were in the middle of an erection.\n\nOh, of course.\n\nIt's right here in my hand.\n\nWhat does she want from me now?\n\nWhat's up?\n\nDo not overthink this.\n\nI don't understand.\n\nBup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.\n\nOkay, but earlier it seemed like...\n\nNo talking.\n\nEven during?

It's right here after \"providing a confirmation sniff on questionable dairy products.\"\n\nYou know what, I am sick of the Roommate Agreement.\n\nIt's ridiculous.\n\nI'm your roommate, not your chauffeur.\n\nYou know, I had better things to do yesterday than drive you all the way to the \"good\" model train store in Garden Grove because the one in Pasadena has gotten \"too big for its britches.\"\n\nWell, it <i>has.</i>\n\nAsk anybody.\n\nI don't care.\n\nI'm done.\n\nHold on.\n\nAre you saying that you want to invoke Clause 209?\n\nI don't know what that is, but if it means I can go home and sleep, then yes.\n\nThink carefully here.\n\nClause 209 suspends our friendship, and strips down the\n\nRoommate Agreement to its bare essentials.\n\nOur responsibilities toward each other would only be rent, utilities and a perfunctory chin jut of recognition as we pass in the hall. 'Sup?\n\nWhere do I sign?\n\nRight here.\n\nUse your finger.\n\nThere. Done.\n\nAll right.\n\nThat's it. We are now no longer companions, boon or otherwise.\n\nWe are not merely acquaintances.\n\nTo amend the words of <i>Toy Story--</i> \"You have not got a friend in me.\"\n\nI'm gonna go home and take a nap.\n\nYeah, well, tell it to someone who cares.\n\nI got pretty exciting\n\nNASA news today.\n\nNext week I fly to Houston for orientation and zero-gravity elimination drills.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nHe's gonna learn to poop in space.\n\nOpen the pod bay doors, HAL.\n\nMaybe <i>your</i> nickname should be \"Brown Dynamite.\"\n\nHello, dear friends.\n\nAnd Dr. Hofstadter. 'Sup? 'Sup?\n\nMy apologies.\n\nI would've been here sooner, but the bus kept stopping for other people to get on it.\n\nI saved you a dumpling.\n\nOh, your concern for me is touching.\n\nIt will serve you well when you take me to the dentist tomorrow.\n\nI'm sorry, Sheldon, I'm busy.\n\nI'm right in the middle of my addiction study.\n\nI've got a lab full of alcoholic monkeys, and tomorrow's the day we switch them to O'Doul's.\n\nYou're my girlfriend and you're not going to cater to my every need?\n\nOh, where'd the magic go?\n\nSheldon, that's not what girlfriends are for.\n\nAlthough, you don't use them for what they're for, so what do <i>I</i> know?\n\nHoward doesn't make me do his shopping or take him to the dentist or pick up his dry cleaning, right?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nBut when Ma's hips give out, you're up, kid.\n\nWell, if Amy's too busy, that gives the rest of you an opportunity to make my life easier, thus assuring yourselves a footnote in my memoirs, tentatively entitled\n\nAll right, then, just shout when you hear the task you want to undertake.\n\nUh, dentist.\n\nOkay, w-we can circle back to that one.\n\nUm, well, who wants to take me Wednesday morning to get new heels put on my dress shoes?\n\nAnyone?\n\nOh. That one had hoot written all over it.\n\nUm, all right, uh, dermatologist.\n\nAllergist.\n\nPodiatrist.\n\nSupercuts?\n\nOkay, okay, here's a fun one.\n\nUm, I need a new picture frame for Swedish meatballs.\n\nWho wants to spend the day with me at IKEA?\n\nTheir meatballs are pretty good.\n\nWhat's that?\n\nNothing, nothing.\n\nHello, Stuart.\n\nOh, hey, Sheldon.\n\nCan I help you find something today?\n\nNo, no.\n\nI was just sitting at home thinking about how it might be nice to catch up with my ninth favorite person.\n\nNinth?\n\nYou moved up one.\n\nMy pen pal in Somalia was kidnapped by pirates.\n\nSo, uh... how are you?\n\nUh... not so good.\n\nMy shrink just killed himself and... blamed me in the note.\n\nGreat. Great.\n\nSo, what's new with your family?\n\nHow's your mother?\n\nIs she alive?\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd your father? Alive?\n\nYes.\n\nHow about your grandparents, they alive?\n\nNo.\n\nOh, I'm so sorry for your loss.\n\nOn a cheerier note,\n\nI have a teeth-cleaning appointment this afternoon.\n\nWhat do you say you take me over there, buddy boy?\n\nI'm sorry, you want me to take you to the dentist?\n\nYes. Now, I can't make any promises, but that's the sort of thing that gets a fella on the short list for the number eight friend slot.\n\nSheldon, I'm working.\n\nI can't take you to the dentist.\n\nAlso-- and I can't stress this enough--\n\nI don't <i>want</i> to take you to the dentist.\n\nCan't help a friend out in a time of need, huh?\n\nI see where your therapist was coming from.\n\nOoh, ooh! What about we make your astronaut nickname\n\nHoward \"Buzz\" Wolowitz?\n\nYou can't do \"Buzz.\" \"Buzz\" is taken.\n\nBuzz Lightyear is not real.\n\nNo, that's not what\n\nI'm talking about.\n\nWell, are you talking about when he <i>thought</i> he was real?\n\nNo.\n\nOkay, um... how about \"Crash\"?\n\nHoward \"Crash\" Wolowitz.\n\nYeah, terrific.\n\nThe other astronauts would love to go hurtling through space with a guy named \"Crash.\"\n\nAll right, um, how about...\n\nOh, how about \"Rocket Man\"?\n\nThat's not bad,\n\nHoward \"Rocket Man\" Wolowitz.\n\nYeah, it's great, but I told you,\n\nI don't get to pick my nickname.\n\nIt has to come from the other astronauts.\n\nMaybe there's a way to get them to come up with it.\n\nLike how?\n\nOnce I tried carrying around a Duncan yo-yo, hoping the other kids would start calling me Duncan.\n\nDid it work?\n\nNo, they ended up calling me Sock Mouth.\n\nBecause they took away my yo-yo and stuffed their socks in my mouth.\n\nOkay, uh, what if we make \"Rocket Man\" your ringtone, and the next time you talk to those guys,\n\nI'll call you and they'll hear it.\n\nPlant the seed.\n\nThat's actually not a terrible plan.\n\nThey don't call me \"Brown Dynamite\" for nothing. 'Sup? 'Sup?\n\nHey, did you ever make it to the dentist?\n\nNot necessary. No.\n\nI found a service that'll send a van to your house for a teeth cleaning.\n\nMostly they cater to dogs, but... ...the fellow on the phone seemed to have an open mind.\n\nAll right, Sheldon, if you need me to take you to the dentist,\n\nI will take you to the dentist.\n\nAre you suggesting that you've come to your senses and wish to reestablish the mutual benefits that stem from full participation in the Roommate Agreement?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nIf you admit that you're a 30-year-old man who's incapable of functioning on his own.\n\nOoh, Sock Mouth's got him on the ropes.\n\nI will admit nothing of the sort.\n\nAnd now if you'll excuse me,\n\nI have to call my dentist and see if I can also get my hair shampooed and my nails clipped.\n\nOh, good, your power's out, too.\n\nWhy is that good?\n\nBecause last month,\n\nI sent the electric company a Starbucks gift card, an apology note, and a few snapshots of me in a bra.\n\nPower failure.\n\nImplementing power-failure protocol.\n\nWhat happened to all your glow- in-the-dark-emergency-exit stuff you had painted on the floor?\n\nOh, that was wildly carcinogenic.\n\nAnyway... it's too bad you're no longer entitled to the full benefits of my friendship, because I happen to be extremely prepared for such an emergency.\n\nPlease try not to see anything by this light.\n\nIt's not for you.\n\nIt's just a blackout; I'm sure the power will be back on soon.\n\nAnd I'm sure some fool in the Donner party said the snow would stop any day now.\n\nI like to think they ate him first.\n\nYou know, I got some candles in my apartment.\n\nBut candles?!\n\nDuring a blackout?!\n\nAre you mad?\n\nThat's a fire hazard.\n\nNo, Pasadena\n\nWater and Power recommends the far safer glow stick.\n\nYou call that a glow stick?\n\nCome on, let's go.\n\nBefore you go, consider this.\n\nNot only do I have a deep-cycle marine battery power source which is more than capable of running our entertainment system,\n\nI also have all 61 episodes of the BBC series <i>Red Dwarf...</i> and Fiddle-Faddle.\n\nAll yours if you're willing to reinstate the Roommate Agreement.\n\nI've got wine at my place and some bubble wrap we could pop.\n\nOh, he'll be back.\n\nWine and a girl in the dark-- he's gonna be bored out of his mind.\n\nTo wine and bubble wrap.\n\nAnd to not having to watch\n\nSheldon demonstrate his reverse osmosis machine that converts urine into drinking water.\n\nYou know, in Girl Scouts,\n\nTammie Dineesha said you could do that with panty hose.\n\nBoy, was she wrong.\n\nAnyway, you want to make out?\n\nI thought because our relationship's in a beta test, you wanted to take things slow.\n\nOkay.\n\nDo you want to make out slow?\n\nI can go so slow it'll be like there's a snail in your mouth.\n\nUgh.\n\nWell, lucky for you, there's nothing else to do right now.\n\nExcuse me, Leonard.\n\nSince when don't you knock?\n\nIt's like the only good thing about you.\n\nSocial niceties have been suspended, Leonard.\n\nWe're in a state of a emergency.\n\nThe world has descended into darkened turmoil.\n\nLawlessness and savagery are the order of the day.\n\nFine, what is it?\n\nI'm making s'mores.\n\nI wanted to alert you in case you smelled caramelizing marshmallows and thought a nearby candy factory was on fire.\n\nS'mores, huh?\n\nGood for you.\n\nYes, or good for us if you sign here and reinstate the full Roommate Agreement.\n\nNo, thanks. I'm good.\n\nReally?\n\nHuh! Okay.\n\nIn that case, I will have a s'more by myself.\n\nAnd then I'm gonna have s'more.\n\nBy myself.\n\nAw.\n\nNo, don't \"aw\" him.\n\nHe brought this all on himself.\n\nBut he's sad.\n\nNo, he's crazy.\n\nSometimes crazy looks like sad so it'll suck you back in.\n\nI think he misses his little buddy.\n\nFine.\n\nBut mark my words, this frustrating, bogus teenage make-out session is not over.\n\nI thought you said candles were dangerous.\n\nThis is a Bunsen burner.\n\nI'm a scientist;\n\nI know what I'm doing.\n\nOh, drat.\n\nAww.\n\nIt took me a gallon of urine to make that water.\n\nListen, Sheldon, this is stupid.\n\nI don't see why we can't be friends.\n\nAnd I'm willing to drive you around and help you out with stuff.\n\nI just don't want to do it because of some silly Roommate Agreement.\n\nWhat are you proposing?\n\nThat we go back to the way things were.\n\nBut when I do something for you, you show a little appreciation.\n\nAnd how would I do that?\n\nYou say \"thank you.\"\n\nEvery time?\n\nIt's not crazy.\n\nCounter-proposal.\n\nWe reinstate the full\n\nRoommate Agreement with the following addendum: in the spirit of Mother's Day or Father's Day, once a year, we set aside a day to celebrate all your contributions to my life, both actual and imagined by you.\n\nWe could call it Leonard's Day.\n\nI kind of like the sound of that.\n\nOf course you do.\n\nIt's about you, like everything else.\n\nOh, thank goodness.\n\nI don't think I had it in me to make another glass of water.\n\nSo, do I get breakfast in bed on Leonard's Day?\n\nNo.\n\nCan I sit in your spot?\n\nNo.\n\nCan I control the thermostat?\n\nNo.\n\nDo I get a card?\n\nOf course you get a card.\n\nIt's Leonard's Day.\n\nHey, guys, the building manager said the reason the power went out is someone went down into the basement and just pulled the main breaker switch.\n\nReally.\n\nWho do you think did that, Sheldon?\n\nOh, I don't know.\n\nBut whoever that mystery man was, you should be eternally grateful, for without him, there would be no Leonard's Day.\n\nLeonard's Day?\n\nOh, no pressure.\n\nJust get him a crummy card, you're good.\n\nAll right, test my ring tone. \"Rocket Man\" plays)\n\nThat really is a good song.\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nThere's a reason he's <i>Sir</i> Elton John.\n\nThey don't make you a knight for writing \"Wake Me Up\n\nBefore You Go Go.\"\n\nMRS.

That is not true.\n\nBernadette wants a prenup.\n\nWow. That's rough.\n\nSo you're saying if I became a famous movie star, we got married, you wouldn't sign a prenup?\n\nAbsolutely not.\n\nIf I'm gonna be stuck at home with the kids while you're on location cheating on me with Ryan Gosling... then Leonard gots to get paid.\n\nSo, you think about us getting married?\n\nI think about a lot of things.\n\nI think about us getting married,\n\nI think about us breaking up.\n\nOnce in a while, I think about how I didn't leave a note on that Mercedes\n\nI dinged in the parking lot last month, but then I have a glass of wine and it passes.\n\nJoke all you want, but you think about it.\n\nWell, tell you one thing, if I ever do get married, no Klingon invitations.\n\nGood luck catching a man with that attitude.\n\nBoy, oh, boy!\n\nThis vacation is off to a wonderful start.\n\nThe smell of formaldehyde... the whir of the centrifuge, the distant chatter of lab animals being dispatched for dissection.\n\nMm, I can already feel my cares just melting away.\n\nI'm excited to work with my boyfriend.\n\nIt's gonna be romantic.\n\nWay to kill the mood.\n\nCome on, Sheldon.\n\nWe can be like Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre, who spent their days working side by side, bathed in the glow of their love and the radium that ultimately killed her.\n\nScrew <i>Beauty and the Beast;</i>\n\nDisney should tell.\n\nOkay, what do we start with?\n\nMaybe splicing some genes, clone a sheep, perhaps grow a human ear on a mouse's back?\n\nHa-ha, I'm a freak!\n\nOh, I'm gonna be doing some brain stem histology while you put yourself on the business end of a sponge and wash those beakers.\n\nWash those bea...\n\nOh, I get it, a little hazing for the new fella.\n\nYeah, I'd better keep and eye out for, what, shoe polish on the microscope, or mad cow disease in my grilled cheese sandwich?\n\nNo, I just need those beakers washed.\n\nHippity-hop, quick like a bunny.\n\nWha...? Excuse me, you have\n\nDr. Sheldon Cooper in your lab.\n\nYou're gonna make him do the dishes?\n\nThat's like asking the Incredible Hulk to open a pickle jar.\n\nSheldon, you've never worked in a lab like this before.\n\nYou have no experience in the field of biology.\n\nI have plenty of experience in biology.\n\nI bought a Tamagotchi in 1998.\n\nAnd... it's still alive.\n\nLet's do this.\n\nWhere's Howard?\n\nNo \"Hi, Raj\"?\n\nNo \"How are you, Raj?\"\n\nJust straight to \"Where's the other white guy?\"\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nSo, listen,\n\nI heard something about him.\n\nCan you keep it between us?\n\nOoh, gossip.\n\nWhen I first got here,\n\nI thought you Americans really gossiped around the water cooler.\n\nSo I hung out there for, like, a month, but the only gossip I ever heard was about some creepy guy hanging out by the water cooler.\n\nBernadette wants to get a prenup.\n\nOh, that's a shame-- he's gonna be devastated.\n\nI never know what to do in these situations.\n\nShould I give him a heads-up?\n\nHmm. I'm gonna give you the same advice\n\nI yell at the TV when the\n\nBachelor's handing out roses.\n\nFollow your heart.\n\nCheck it out.\n\nLook at the size of that\n\nRice Krispie Treat!\n\nSame price. (chuckles)\n\nHey, Howard, I need to tell you something.\n\nI know, it's not on my wedding diet.\n\nI don't care.\n\nUh, l-listen, I... heard that Bernadette's thinking about asking you for a prenup.\n\nA prenup?\n\nWhat are you gonna do?\n\nI... don't know.\n\nFollow your heart.\n\nYou know what, it's... not a big deal.\n\nShe makes more money than me.\n\nShe wants to protect her financial interests.\n\nIt's completely reasonable.\n\nGood. That's a healthy attitude.\n\nYeah, actually, it's good for both of us.\n\nI have assets to protect, too.\n\nLike what?\n\nI've got some rare comic books.\n\nThe Vespa's almost paid off.\n\nAnd Ma and I have a primo double cemetery plot at Mt.

I'll have you know, in the field of physics, we work with particles so small, they make fat jokes about the locus coeruleus.\n\nI.e., when your locus coeruleus sits around the house, it sits <i>around</i> the house.\n\nOh... are we nervous,\n\nDr. Cooper?\n\nNo.\n\nWhat you see is a man trembling with confidence.\n\nDoes a locus coeruleus normally bleed that much?\n\nNo. But your thumb does.\n\nOh, dear.\n\nYeah, <i>you're</i> a biologist.\n\nWhat are you doing here?\n\nI'm on vacation.\n\nSocial convention dictates that I let my hair down at a local watering hole.\n\nSocial convention is stupid.\n\nWhat happened to your thumb?\n\nYou know, I have ten fingers and ten toes.\n\nIf I tell you a story about each one of them, we'll be here all day-- let's just move on.\n\nWhat can I get you?\n\nAh, seeing as I'm on vacation, uh, pi\u00f1a colada seems appropriate.\n\nExtra pineapple slices, extra whipped cream, extra cherries, extra umbrellas, and, uh, hold the rum.\n\nDon't let me have too many of those.\n\nHey, what are you guys doing here?\n\nWe're grown men; we drink at bars.\n\nNo and no.\n\nEverything okay with you and Bernadette?\n\nOh, yeah, sure.\n\nYou and Amy? Good?\n\nOh, better than good.\n\nYou know those girls text me every detail of their lives as it happens.\n\nI'm not signing a prenup.\n\nAll right, Howard Wolowitz, listen up.\n\nYou sign anything she puts in front of you, because you are the luckiest man alive.\n\nIf you let her go, there is no way you can find anyone else-- speaking on behalf of all women, it is not gonna happen; we had a meeting.\n\nAnd you, a grown man fainting at the sight of a little blood.\n\nExcuse me, this is a fairly substantial wound.\n\nYou...\n\nSHELDON: Amy? Amy?\n\nAmy?\n\nWhat do you want?\n\nI was kind of hoping\n\nI could continue vacationing in your laboratory.\n\nAfter all, I did book the whole week.\n\nDo you honestly think you can just waltz back in here after the way you behaved yesterday?\n\nI was not myself.\n\nI had lost a lot of thumb blood.\n\nThat's not an apology.\n\nThat is your opinion.\n\nI want a real apology.\n\nI'm sorry that you weren't able to...\n\nNo. ...that my genius...\n\nNo. ...that the soap was...\n\nSheldon.\n\nFine.\n\nSorry.\n\nYou're forgiven.\n\nNow, if you want to stay, get started on those beakers.\n\nThey're still dirty from yesterday.\n\nNext year I'm going to Epcot.\n\nAre you mad at me?\n\nNo. I'm not mad at you.\n\nI just... wish you would have come to me, so I didn't have to hear it through the nerd-vine.\n\nSo, what are we gonna do?\n\nYou really want me to sign a prenup?\n\nI don't know.\n\nMy dad's pretty insistent on it, though.\n\nWhy don't I talk to your dad, man-to-man?\n\nReally?\n\nOh, that'd be so great!\n\nDone.\n\nI should probably give you a heads-up about a couple of things.\n\nEven though he's retired from the police force, he still carries his gun.\n\nBut don't worry, he won't shoot it.\n\nIt's more of a fashion statement.\n\nOkay.\n\nAnd just to be safe, when you talk to him, don't bring up Jimmy Carter, gardeners, foreign people, homosexuals,\n\nSean Penn, Vatican II, gun control, organic food, the designated hitter rule, recycling or the fact that you're Jewish.\n\nGot it, got it.\n\nWill you e-mail me that list?\n\nSo the thing to watch for, if he's shouting at you, you're okay, but if he starts to get real quiet, leave as quickly as you can without making eye contact.\n\nNot in a straight line-- throw some zigs and zigs in there.\n\nYou know, this isn't that pressing.\n\nWhy don't I talk to him about it in May.\n\nIn May you're gonna be on the International Space Station.\n\nThey got a phone. == sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "7ec52836-53a5-4c74-936d-74e0fb3a5764": {"__data__": {"id_": "7ec52836-53a5-4c74-936d-74e0fb3a5764", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "0861a71cdabc9129a78ef2694fd67372ef96a0d3de635685b03d6d1000944e3c", "text": "  \ufeff1\n\nIt was a nice retirement party. visit tvshowslatest.blogspot.com to download\n\nI guess.\n\nStill, it's a shame\n\nProfessor Rothman was forced to step down.\n\nWhat choice did the university have?\n\nHe snapped.\n\nIt happens to theoretical physicists all the time.\n\nI wonder how long\n\nSheldon's got.\n\nThese shrimp are all the same size.\n\nThere's no the logical order to eat them in.\n\nCan't be very long.\n\nHey, look, there's Rothman's empty office.\n\nSad.\n\nMm, indeed.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo sad.\n\nDibs.\n\nWhat's up, fellas?\n\nWhat are you doing here, Kripke?\n\nAh, measuring my new office for drapes.\n\nThis is not your office.\n\nIt hasn't been assigned yet.\n\nWell, I called dibs at the Christmas party when Professor Rothman tried to have intercourse with the Toys for Tots collection box.\n\nDibs?!\n\nThis is a university, not a playground.\n\nOffices are not assigned because someone called dibs.\n\nYou just called dibs.\n\nShut it.\n\nOffices are assigned by seniority.\n\nI arrived at the university first.\n\nI arrived at the office first.\n\nI'm the proverbial early bird.\n\nGentlemen.\n\nALL:\n\nProfessor Rothman.\n\nGood evening. \"Good evening\" )\n\nI'm glad that men are wearing hats again.\n\nThey're so distinguished. \u266a Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \u266a \u266a Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started...

Can I come, too?\"\n\nAnd then I didn't answer for a second, and then she said, \"Well, do you not want me to come?\"\n\nAnd then I bought her a new laptop and the game, and she's parking the car right now.\n\nIs the whip sound app contextually appropriate here?\n\nUh, it is, but I think you might've waited too long for it to be funny.\n\nI was wrong; it's still funny.\n\nOh, good.\n\nOh.\n\nAmy, what's wrong?\n\nMy boyfriend's a jerk.\n\nWell, I know he didn't cheat on you, so what happened?\n\nI had to go to my aunt's party all by myself, and everybody was like, \"Where's this boyfriend you're always talking about? \"Is he real, or did you make him up like Armen, the miniature horse breeder?\"\n\nWho's Armen the miniature horse breeder?\n\nThe pretend boyfriend I invented to get my family off my back.\n\nIt unraveled quickly when\n\nI couldn't answer the question \"How'd you two meet?\"\n\nI would have thought at a miniature horse show.\n\nOh, that's good.\n\nMm.\n\nI panicked and said Woodstock.\n\nI just wanted to show Sheldon off to my family.\n\nSure, I get that.\n\nI mean, he's your first boyfriend and all.\n\nNot just my first boyfriend, he's the best boyfriend.\n\nI mean, think about it.\n\nI'm dating Sheldon Cooper.\n\nYes.\n\nOn purpose.\n\nHe's handsome, he's lanky, he's brilliant, and his skin has that pale, waxy quality.\n\nWell, sickly is the new sexy.\n\nYeah.\n\nMm.\n\nYou know, Amy, sometimes when you're in a relationship with someone you really care about, the sucky part is, it leaves you open to getting hurt.\n\nDo you ever worry about\n\nLeonard doing that to you?\n\nThat's hilarious. No.\n\nGet that guy!\n\nGet that guy!\n\nPew! Pew! Pew! Pew!\n\nDr. Rostenkowski, it may interest you to know that saying \"pew, pew, pew\" isn't as effective as pressing your blaster key.\n\nIn the same way that saying \"whee!\" doesn't make the land speeder go.\n\nPew!\n\nRaj, Imperial Troopers on your tail.\n\nWhen Gandhi advocated his philosophy of non-violence,\n\nI bet he didn't know how much fun it was killing stuff.\n\nAll right, I think we got them all.\n\nLet's divide up the loot.\n\nBERNADETTE: Ooh, look at this pretty purple robe I just got.\n\nYou should put on yours and then we'll match.\n\nBut I worked hard to get this armor.\n\nSorry, I just thought it'd be nice if people knew we were a couple.\n\nFine, I'll change.\n\nI don't think I want to play a game.\n\nOh, come on!\n\nThey're playing one across the hall-- we should, too.\n\nOkay, we are gonna take turns bouncing a quarter off the table, and if it goes into this cup, the other person has to drink.\n\nThen you get to go again...\n\nLike that?\n\nWow. Yeah, b-beginner's luck.\n\nSo, now I will drink this entire cup of beer, and you will go again...\n\nUh...\n\nAll right. So, yeah, okay, now I'm gonna drink this entire cup and then\n\nI'm going to drink another one. seriously, stop.

I got away with it.\n\nLeonard has his toy, and he's never going to open it, so he won't know it's broken.\n\nAnd I have a toy that isn't broken.\n\nEverybody's happy.\n\nI thought where you come from they don't have emotions.\n\nYou know what you are?\n\nWell, you're a green-blooded buzz kill.\n\nPerhaps it's time you beam on out of here.\n\nFine.\n\nOh, right.\n\nVery well.\n\nCooper to <i>Enterprise,</i> one to beam up.\n\nEnergize.\n\nTiny Spock, help.\n\nReady for lunch?\n\nYeah, one sec.\n\nOh, good.\n\nMa would've killed me if she found out\n\nI broke my retainer.\n\nHey, uh... can I run something by you?\n\nIt's about Lakshmi.\n\nYeah, sure.\n\nHow are things going?\n\nWe hit a couple of bumps.\n\nShe lives over in Manhattan Beach, so it takes, like, an hour to get there.\n\nAnd she's a lesbian.\n\nWhat do you mean, \"she's a lesbian\"?\n\nWell, you know how whenever you and I would try to hit on women in bars and they'd blow us off and then we'd tell each other they were probably gay?\n\nIt's like that.\n\nExcept this time, it's true.\n\nThen why did she even go out with you?\n\nShe was looking for a husband so she can appear to be straight.\n\nAnd, you know, it sounded crazy to me at first... but I'm actually thinking about doing it.\n\nOkay, so the reason that might sound crazy... is 'cause it's <i>crazy!</i>\n\nLook, Howard, you're in a relationship.\n\nYou know you have to make compromises.\n\nYes, but my compromises are about which bedspread to buy or whose turn it is to do the laundry,\n\nBernadette's or my mom's.\n\nIt's a great deal.\n\nWe both get our parents off our backs,\n\nI don't have to come home to an empty apartment every night.\n\nPlus, once I'm married, I can finally eat carbs again and let myself go.\n\nWhy don't you tell your parents you want to try to find someone else?\n\nMaybe one who hasn't slept with more woman than you.\n\nBecause this one wants to marry me.\n\nI might never find another one who does.\n\nSo you're seriously thinking about marrying someone you're never gonna have sex with?\n\nI can't believe your attitude.\n\nI thought you were in favor of gay people getting married.\n\nYes, to other gay people!\n\nDo you hear how homophobic you sound?\n\nOh, I don't want a broken toy.\n\nNothing!\n\nWhat?\n\nNothing. I said nothing.\n\nThat was weird.\n\nReally? I don't even notice anymore.\n\nI cannot believe you guys aren't gonna play with these.\n\nWell, I told you, you don't.\n\nIt's mint-in-box.\n\nI don't know.\n\nI just think it's a waste.\n\nRelax. I'm just looking at the box.\n\nPerhaps you should look with your eyes and not your muscular\n\nNebraska man hands.\n\nWhat is your problem?!\n\nMy problem is that I don't want you to break Leonard's toy.\n\nWhich you probably did by shaking it!\n\nShe shook it, we all saw her.\n\nLeonard, I bought you this 'cause I wanted you to have fun with it.\n\nI don't want it to sit in this box.\n\nYou know, you're right.\n\nI mean, it's from you,\n\nI'm never gonna sell it.\n\nI'm opening it.\n\nYes!\n\nIt's broken.\n\nWhat?\n\nOh, nice job, man hands!\n\nI didn't break it.\n\nI guess Stuart sold it to me like this.\n\nYes.

I always thought you'd be the last one of us to ever get married, because you are so short and unappealing.\n\nAm I right?\n\nLet's see here.\n\nOh, seriously though, Howard, you're actually one of the most intelligent people I know.\n\nAnd that's a zinger, because you're not.\n\nI've always thought that you'd make someone a fine husband someday.\n\nAssuming you'd be able to get the parts, and develop the engineering skills to assemble them, which I don't see as likely.\n\nHacha!\n\nOkay... Let me see here.\n\nOkay, kidding aside--\n\nHoward, you are a good friend.\n\nAnd I wish you nothing but happiness.\n\nBazinga, I don't!\n\nSheldon...\n\nDoubleazinga! I do!\n\nGood luck following that.\n\nSo, Howard Wolowitz tying the knot.\n\nLeaving his crazy bachelor days behind.\n\nHe was a wild one.\n\nWell, I guess we all kind of were.\n\nI remember this one time,\n\nI was with this girl at the beach.\n\nWe were in the ocean and we started making out.\n\nI know, it was crazy.\n\nI wasn't even wearing my Aquasocks.\n\nThen...\n\nNobody cares, Hofstadter.\n\nWrap it up.\n\nRight.\n\nTo Howard.\n\nTo Howard.\n\nI totally had sex in the ocean.\n\nOkay, I'll go.\n\nHoward, when I think about you and Bernadette starting this wonderful life together,\n\nI can't help but get a little choked up.\n\nI mean... look at you.\n\nYou have everything.\n\nLook at me.\n\nI'm 37.\n\nI sleep in the back of a comic book store, and I have the bone density of an 80-year-old man.\n\nTo Howard.\n\nYeah, to Howard.\n\nYes...\n\nUm, uh, who's next?\n\nI'll go.\n\nHoward, I'm gonna say something to you that everybody's thinking but no one has the courage to say out loud.\n\nWhen you invite a man to a bachelor party, the implication is, there will be strippers.\n\nMaybe not completely nude, but at least pasties and G-strings.\n\nThat's not unreasonable.\n\nHear, hear.\n\nHear, hear.\n\nOkay, uh, anybody else?\n\nHuh? No?\n\nOkay, it all comes down to me, the best man.\n\nOoh! This grasshopper is kicking my ass-hopper.\n\nOkay, okay, when I first came to this country,\n\nI-I didn't know how to behave or how to dress, or what was cool...\n\nI was pretty lonely.\n\nBut then I met Howard, and suddenly, my life changed, because we could be lonely together.\n\nThis man became my whole world.\n\nYeah, nice speech, Francine.\n\nI'm not done, but thank you.\n\nI think back.... ...to all the good times we had, like, uh, when we went camping and spent that night telling each other all our secrets.\n\nI told him I'm addicted to pedicures and he told me he lost his virginity to his cousin.\n\nShe was my second cousin.\n\nAnd the first woman you ever disappointed sexually.\n\nBa-da-bazinga!\n\nOh... oh, yeah, and then there was the time when Leonard and I took\n\nHoward to Las Vegas and paid a hooker to pretend she was Jewish and that she wanted his little kosher pickle.\n\nOf all the \"Howard humping hookers\" stories, that one's my favorite!\n\nOkay, buddy, that's it.\n\nSit down.\n\nOh, oh, what about that tubby girl in the Sailor Moon costume at Comic-con?\n\nDon't remember.\n\nPlease sit down.\n\nThe only threesome\n\nI've ever had in my life, and I'm proud to say it was with this man right here.\n\nOh, please shut up.\n\nOh, oh, don't get me wrong, nothing happened with me and Howard.\n\nThere was about 200 pounds of Sailor Moon between us.\n\nOh, Internet, this is so going all over you.\n\nJeepers, I'm drunk.\n\nThank you for picking us up.\n\nThere's a warning, right there, on the scotch bottle.\n\nYou cannot be operatin' heavy machinery after you had a snootful of this, laddie!\n\nFunny.\n\nYou boys have a nice time?\n\nYeah, it was great.\n\nLow-key, like I promised.\n\nNo hanky-panky, no strippers.\n\nJust the guys telling jokes.\n\nThat's nice.\n\nHow about you?\n\nDid you have a fun night?\n\nYeah, we, uh, made gift bags, had wine, and then went online and saw this.\n\nOf all the \"Howard humping hookers\" stories, that one's my favorite.\n\nYou know, we're not that far from my apartment.\n\nIf you stop the car,\n\nI can walk from here.\n\nYou ain't goin' anywhere, Threeway.\n\nBernadette, listen...\n\nYou lied to me.\n\nYou said you told me about all the girls you've been with, but you never mentioned your cousin, the prostitute or Raj!\n\nSeriously, you don't even have to stop the car.\n\nAnything under ten miles an hour and I can combat-roll into the street.\n\nOkay, just to set the record straight,\n\nI didn't hire the prostitute, she was a gift from him.\n\nShame on you, Raj.\n\nThat is not how we treat women in this country.\n\nDon't you try and blame this on him.\n\nThank you, Bernadette.\n\nZip it, pervert!\n\nI don't know what\n\nI'm going to do.\n\nI'm supposed to marry Howard in a couple weeks and I'm not sure I even know who the man is anymore.\n\nI'm curious what's bothering you most: the borderline incest, the prostitute or group sex with the girl dressed as the children's cartoon?\n\nAmy, remember when we went over things that would be helpful and things that wouldn't?\n\nRight.\n\nAnd that was...\n\nNot.\n\nWhen I first met Howard, he seemed so innocent to me, just a sweet little guy who lives with his mother.\n\nWell, if that's what you like, I'll take you to the comic book store-- the place is full of 'em.\n\nWait a minute.\n\nYou set me up with Howard.\n\nDid you know about all the creepy stuff he was into?\n\nWell, a little.\n\nYou hear stuff...\n\nWhy didn't you tell me\n\nWell, I was gonna, but I didn't think it would go past the first date.\n\nThen, when it did,\n\nI thought for sure it wouldn't go past you meeting his mother.\n\nDefinitely not past the two of you sleeping together.\n\nI mean, the warning signs were there-- this is really on you.\n\nGod!\n\nI thought you were my friend.\n\nI don't think that was helpful.\n\nHi, Bernie, it's me again.\n\nPlease call me back.\n\nDude, I am so sorry.\n\nIt's not your fault, it's mine.\n\nI did all that stuff, not you.\n\nActually, you did do one of them together.\n\nHere.\n\nWhat is this?\n\nYou're upset.\n\nThe convention is to bring an upset person a hot beverage.\n\nNo, but what is it?\n\nChicken broth.\n\nIt seemed culturally appropriate.\n\nAlso, there was a single cube of chicken bouillon in the cupboard when I moved in and it's been bothering me for the last eight years...\n\nSo, as they say, two birds.\n\nI don't know what my next move is.\n\nWell, Howard, I don't know much about women...\n\nYeah?\n\nNo, uh, that, that's it.\n\nI don't know much about women.\n\nRaj, you got anything?\n\nI've got the phone number of the tubby girl from Comic-Con.\n\nI'm not calling the girl from Comic-con.\n\nAll right.\n\nMore Sailor Moon for me.\n\nI just threw up the bachelor party.\n\nPlease come out, Bernadette.\n\nLet's talk through this.\n\nNo, leave me alone.\n\nPerhaps you should give him a taste of his own medicine.\n\nDo you have a cousin who you find attractive?\n\nAmy.\n\nHey, you introduced him to the sleazebag.\n\nI'm just trying to clean up your mess.\n\nOh, hi.\n\nHi.\n\nI need to talk to Bernadette.\n\nWell, I don't think she wants to talk to anyone right now.\n\nAll right, well, could you at least give her a message?\n\nYeah, sure, I guess.\n\nTell her I'm really sorry.\n\nAnd if she doesn't want to marry me, I get it.\n\nBut what I really want her to know is the guy that she's disgusted by, is the guy that\n\nI'm disgusted by, too.\n\nBut that guy doesn't exist anymore; he's gone.\n\nAnd the reason is because of her.\n\nSo, if this relationship is over, let her know that she made me a better man, and tell her thank you.\n\nOh, my God, Howard.\n\nThat's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.\n\nAnd it came out of you.\n\nHowie?\n\nPenny has a message for you.\n\nI heard.\n\nYour voice, not unlike your mother's, travels through walls.\n\nDo you want me to go?\n\nNo.\n\nCome here.\n\nI'm still really mad at you.\n\nI get that.\n\nIs there anything else about your past I should know?\n\nCouple things, but, you know, most of them happened overseas.\n\nI'll tell you later.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo, is the wedding still on?\n\nYeah, the wedding's still on.\n\nOh, thank God.\n\nI'm still a maid of honor!\n\nOh, what the hell.\n\nThis is kind of hot.\n\nHello.\n\nWhat's with the robe?\n\nI'm gonna have sex with you right here, right now, on that washing machine.\n\nNo, you're not.\n\nCome on, please.\n\nIf you want to do something, you can help me fold this sheet.\n\nFolding a sheet in my underwear, still

Oh, and just a heads-up... mm, since the last time you saw me naked,\n\nI got a Cookie Monster tattoo.\n\nThe acceptable responses when you see it are \"awesome\" or nothing.\n\nWhat about...\n\nCookies!\n\nAmy?\n\nAmy?\n\nAmy?\n\nIt's not an accident.\n\nI waited outside your door for 20 minutes.\n\nWell, dinner's almost ready.\n\nI must say,\n\nI was surprised you chose to spend our date night in your apartment.\n\nAs I mentioned, the Pasadena City Council is debating longer crosswalk times, and later, the LEGO store is having a midnight madness sale.\n\nYou ask anyone, that's a hot date.\n\nTempting choices, but I have something special planned for tonight.\n\nWhat can be more special than having an adequate amount of time to cross the street on your way to buy a tiny LEGO Indiana Jones?\n\nWith our friends moving forward in their relationships,\n\nI've decided that we should make progress in ours as well.\n\nOh, dear Lord.\n\nTwo years ago, we didn't even know each other, and now I'm in your apartment after dark.\n\nHow much faster can this thing go?\n\nI had a feeling you'd be reluctant, which is why\n\nI'm going to dip into my neurobiological bag of tricks.\n\nOh, you brain monkeys kill me. Dip away.\n\nI have devised an experiment that\n\nI believe will increase your feelings for me in an accelerated time frame.\n\nAnd how do you propose to do that?\n\nUh, hope you're not thinking about some sort of LSD thought control.\n\nBecause there's only one mind-expanding drug that this man enjoys, and that's called school.\n\nHuman beings form emotional attachments as they grow up.\n\nIn your case, to your mother, superheroes, et cetera.\n\nI'm going to attempt an experiment that will get you to transfer those feelings to me.\n\nWell, seems what's on the menu tonight is malarkey with a big side of poppycock.\n\nWe'll see.\n\nLet's start with a little romantic dinner music, shall we?\n\nSuper Mario Bros. theme?\n\nYes.\n\nI see what you're doing.\n\nYou're attempting to build on the work of Ebbinghaus by triggering an involuntary memory of me playing that game-- admittedly the happiest ...but it won't work.\n\nFine. There's no reason we still can't have a lovely dinner.\n\nWhy don't you have a seat.\n\nBoink! Boink!\n\nMay I offer you something to drink?\n\nYou know I don't drink.\n\nNot even... strawberry Quik?\n\nI love strawberry Quik.\n\nIt's my favorite pink fluid, narrowly beating out\n\nPepto-Bismol.\n\nOh, I know.\n\nI think it will go nicely with what I have prepared... for dinner.\n\nSpaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up in it!\n\nJust like your mommy used to make.\n\nOh... yummy, yummy!\n\nWe should do this more often.\n\nUh-oh.\n\nI'm sorry. I did,\n\nI crossed a line.\n\nI didn't mean to!\n\nWho says something like that right in the middle of sex?!\n\nI don't know, it just came out.\n\nPeople say weird things during sex all the time.\n\nOkay, well, they sure as hell don't say that.\n\nIt was the heat of the moment.\n\nNo, the heat of the moment is, \"Ooh, yeah, just like that,\" not \"will you marry me?\"\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nJust-just give me another chance.\n\nWhy, so you can crawl under the covers and go, \"Hey, baby, want to go look for houses in neighborhoods with good schools?\"\n\nAgain, I'm sorry.\n\nYou know, with Howard and Bernadette getting married,\n\nI got caught up in a little wedding fever.\n\nI take it back.\n\nYou can't take something like that back.\n\nI mean, what are we even supposed to do now?\n\nOkay, at some point, we'll look back and this is going to be a funny story.\n\nWhy don't we just start doing that now?\n\nYou're kidding.\n\nNo.\n\nHey, do you remember... ...that time when I proposed to you in bed?\n\nAnd you were all, like, \"What are <i>you</i> doing?\"\n\nThat was so funny.\n\nSo funny.\n\nIt's not funny.\n\nGive it a minute.\n\nIs that a little smile\n\nI see there?\n\nI should go.\n\nHey, I was thinking.\n\nFor our first dance at the wedding, what if we learn the final number from <i>Dirty Dancing?</i>\n\nYou're kidding.\n\nNo, come on.\n\nHow cool would that be?\n\nMe running into your arms... you lifting me up into the air.\n\nOh, you're in a good mood.\n\nYeah, well, why wouldn't I be?\n\nYou know, I'm marrying the girl of my dreams, and I finally got my mother to agree not to come on our honeymoon.\n\nOh, hang on.\n\nOh, it's NASA.\n\nWolowitz.\n\nOh! Hi, Dave.\n\nWhat's up?\n\nNo kidding. Really?\n\nWell, that's... great news.\n\nGreat, great news.\n\nAll right, I'll watch my e-mail for the details.\n\nOkay, talk soon.\n\nWhat's so great?\n\nIt looks like I'm going into space after all.\n\nOh, Howie, that's wonderful!\n\nUh-huh, wonderful.\n\nYay...\n\nWhat happened?\n\nI thought they canceled your mission.\n\nTh-They did.\n\nBut NASA really wants my telescope up on the space station, so they're putting me on an earlier launch.\n\nWhen?\n\nA... week from Friday.\n\nWhat? We're getting married that Sunday.\n\nYou're right!\n\nI-I can't go to space.\n\nI have to get married, and no one can say that's not a good reason.\n\nI'll call him back.\n\nWait. I don't want to be the one who stands in your way.\n\nWell, too bad, you already did.\n\nIt's a done deal.\n\nOh, well.\n\nBut I forgive you.\n\nNo. That's not how I want to start our marriage, killing your dream?\n\nWe'll have the wedding when you get back.\n\nBut wh-what about all the plans and the guests?\n\nWe'll call them.\n\nAlthough my dad's gonna go a little nutso over losing his deposits.\n\nYou're right, he is!\n\nYour dad's gonna be furious.\n\nThere's no way he's gonna let us postpone this wedding.\n\nWell, we tried.\n\nI'll talk to him.\n\nHe won't say no to his little girl.\n\nNo!\n\nI-I should talk to him, man to man.\n\nBut, Howie, my dad can be a bully.\n\nHe's gonna make you cancel your space flight.\n\nWe can only hope... that he doesn't.\n\nBishop to queen four, level two.\n\nCheck.\n\nSheldon... knight takes bishop.\n\nYou all right?\n\nI'm fine.\n\nAre you?\n\nYou left your queen exposed from above, you trapped your knight in the corner, and you keep sighing and saying, \"Why me?\"\n\nVery well.\n\nCan I ask you a question about women?\n\nWe got you that book last year.\n\nWasn't everything in there?\n\nNo, I'm having a relationship problem with Amy.\n\nAnd by the way, that book gave me nightmares.\n\nWell, if it makes you feel any better,\n\nI screwed things up pretty good with Penny.\n\nLook at us,\n\nLeonard... engaging in the social convention of men bellyaching about their ol' ladies.\n\nI guess we are.\n\nSo, what's going on?\n\nBelieve it or not,\n\nAmy has embarked on a campaign to increase my feelings for her by making me happy.\n\nI'm sorry, that must be very difficult for you.\n\nIt's awful.\n\nThis morning, she arranged for me to be an Amtrak junior conductor for the day.\n\nIt-It's usually only open to children.\n\nShe got them to make an exception.\n\nShame on her.\n\nThey let me blow the whistle, Leonard.\n\nShe's good.\n\nI know.\n\nHer efforts are causing me to have affectionate feelings for her at inappropriate times.\n\nYou mean, like in bed or in the shower?\n\nNo!\n\nWould you please stop referencing that infernal book?\n\nFor example, this morning,\n\nI was calculating the random motion of virtual particles in a vacuum, when suddenly the particles morphed into an image of Amy's dandruff... ...gently cascading down onto her pale, slightly hunched shoulders.\n\nWhat has that vixen done to me, Leonard?\n\nAnd how do I make it stop?\n\nWell, if you had a physical relationship,\n\nI'd say propose during sex.\n\nTurns out that's a real mood killer.\n\nI assume we're talking about you now?\n\nYeah.\n\nSo, that's how this works?\n\nI complain, and then you complain, and no one offers any solutions?\n\nPretty much.\n\nWell, no wonder the women are winning.\n\nMr. Rostenkowski, are you busy?\n\nOh, just looking at some old pictures. Come on in.\n\nFamily pictures, or...?\n\nH-Holy crap, that's a dead person.\n\nLast murder case before I retired.\n\nHow many bodies do you see there?\n\nCareful, it's a trick question.\n\nI'm not sure.\n\nNah, you'll never get it.\n\nIt's a fraction.\n\nHow about that.\n\nAnyway, sir, I need to talk to you about something.\n\nWalnut?\n\nNo, thank you.\n\nI'm allergic.\n\nOh, sure.\n\nMy partner used to have that.\n\nHe's dead now.\n\nFrom nuts?\n\nNah, his wife shot him.\n\nBut she was nuts, so in a way...\n\nNice story.\n\nAnyway, the reason I wanted to talk to you is\n\nNASA has moved up my launch to the International\n\nSpace Station.\n\nYeah, so?\n\nSo... the date is going to conflict with me marrying your daughter.\n\nNow, I know what you're going to say-- I made a commitment to Bernadette and to your family and I've got a hell of a lot of nerve coming in here and demanding that we postpone this thing.\n\nWell, message heard and understood.\n\nMission canceled.\n\nThank you.\n\nWhere are you going?\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nMay I be excused?\n\nNo, you may not.\n\nLet me tell you something.\n\nWhen I first met you...\n\nYou just gonna stand there?\n\nI'm sorry, I didn't know, is this going to...\n\nWell, I should sit...\n\nMay I be seat...\n\nWell, I'll just sit.\n\nWhen I first met you,\n\nI didn't like you.\n\nI'm aware of that, sir.\n\nBut then you and I had some time together.\n\nUh-huh.\n\nIt did not get better.\n\nRight, right.\n\nThat silly Beatle haircut and... you riding around on a red Vespa, and you're still living at home with your mother.\n\nTo be honest, I thought\n\nBernadette chose you to punish me.\n\nBut then I heard about your astronaut thing, and I realized\n\nI judged you too fast.\n\nMaybe you are the right guy for my little girl.\n\nOh, I am.\n\nAnd just so you know,\n\nI'd still be an astronaut, even if I didn't go to space.\n\nI've got an I.D. card and a NASA golf shirt.\n\nNo, no, you got to go.\n\nYou can't turn down an opportunity like this.\n\nB-But what about the wedding and all the money you put down for the reception?\n\nYou let me worry about that.\n\nYou go up to that space station, and you make me proud.\n\nUm, okay.\n\nYou got a problem with that?\n\nAll right, look, I'm gonna level with you.\n\nI'm terrified about going into space.\n\nWhat if I don't make it back?\n\nIt's gonna be okay, son.\n\nYou really think so?\n\nOf course.\n\nA pretty girl like Bernadette... she'll find a new guy.\n\nHey.\n\nHey.\n\nOff to work?\n\nYeah.\n\nHave a nice night.\n\nOkay, you, too.\n\nPenny, just, wait.\n\nI've been thinking about what I said when we were in bed the other night.\n\nYeah, I've been thinking about it, too.\n\nI noticed you never answered me.\n\nYou're right.\n\nNo.\n\nUh, follow-up.\n\nAre we still dating?\n\nYep.\n\nIs it still weird 'cause I proposed?\n\nYep.\n\nI have a couple more quick questions.\n\nDo you want to call me from the car?\n\nNo!\n\nThink I played that pretty well.\n\nHello, Leonard.\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\nWe're playing doctor.\n\nI'm in hell, Leonard.\n\nDon't stop. == sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "f3c9a5d4-d195-49b4-bc60-95196494389d": {"__data__": {"id_": "f3c9a5d4-d195-49b4-bc60-95196494389d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "ca38f41efec1f0851c922b87b091cced6eb50be44b1263bdc1521812d82de8da", "text": "  \ufeff1\n\nThe Big Bang Theory:\n\nWho says something like that right in the middle of sex?!\n\nI don't know.\n\nIt was the heat of the moment!\n\nNo, the heat of the moment is \"Ooh, yeah, just like that.\"\n\nNot, \"Will you marry me?\"\n\nNASA really wants my telescope up on the Space Station, so they're putting me on an earlier launch.\n\nWhen?\n\nA week from Friday.\n\nWhat?

I can't believe my maid of honor dress is going to be on Google Earth.\n\nSo, we have the where and the when, but we still need to figure out who's going to do the ceremony.\n\nWell, that's easy.\n\nAnyone can go online and get ordained as a minister.\n\nI know a piercing parlor, where, for a hundred bucks, they'll marry you and stick a wedding ring through any body part you want.\n\nGreat, well, who's it going to be?\n\nI'll do it, provided I can perform the ceremony in Klingon.\n\nNo.\n\nWhat do you see in her?\n\nLeaking?

I told you no Klingon!\n\nFine, I'll do it in English, but it loses something.\n\nThe need to find another human being to share one's life with, has always puzzled me.\n\nMaybe because I'm so interesting all by myself.\n\nWith that being said, may you find as much happiness with each other as I find on my own.\n\nThe Klingon would have made you cry.\n\nI believe you two have prepared vows?\n\nHoward Joel Wolowitz, like you, this is going to be short and sweet.\n\nI love you with all my heart and soul and promise to be with you forever.\n\nBernadette Maryann\n\nRostenkowski...\n\nSpeak up!\n\nHey, from now on, she's the only women who can yell at me!\n\nUntil I met you,\n\nI couldn't imagine spending my life with just one person... ...and now I can't imagine spending one day of it without you.\n\nBy the power vested in us, by the state of California... and the Klingon High Council... ...we now pronounce you husband and wife.\n\nThat's ignition.\n\nI love this part!\n\nMe, too!\n\nI have strongly mixed feelings!\n\nOh, my God, it's happening.\n\nDid I miss it?\n\nNo, come on in.

On the one hand, I always thought...\n\nYou don't even know what it is, do you?\n\nThe anthropic principle states that if we wish to explain why our universe exists the way it does, the answer is that it must have qualities that allow intelligent creatures to arise who are capable of asking the question.\n\nAs I am doing so eloquently right now.\n\nI know what the anthropic principle is.\n\nOf course.\n\nI just explained it to you.\n\nNow, where do you stand on it?\n\nWhere do you stand on it?\n\nStrongly pro.\n\nThen I believe that God created the world in six days, and on the seventh, he made you to annoy me.\n\nHey, guys.\n\nHey.\n\nYeah, wait, Raj, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?\n\nI'm all for it.\n\nAttaboy!\n\nWell, hang on.\n\nWhy do you believe that he knows what it is and I don't?\n\nOh, Leonard.\n\nLet's not take a saw to the branch we're sitting on, shall we?\n\nHey, uh, if you guys are free tonight, I heard about a spa where you soak your feet in a pool full of little fish that eat all the dead skin right off them.\n\nI don't need to tell you, in Los Angeles, sandal season is year round.\n\nActually, I'm hanging out with Penny.\n\nOh, okay. Sounds like it's me and you, Sheldon.\n\nHow about we sic some guppies on those puppies?\n\nAs I've stated before on numerous occasions, the only sea creature I would even consider being eaten by is the Kraken, because the last words I would hear are: \"Release the Kraken.\"\n\nThat never gets old. \"Release the Kraken!\"\n\nOh, chills.\n\nBesides, I'm having dinner with Amy.\n\nOh, okay. I'll just go home and be alone.\n\nW-Which is cool.\n\nI eat alone, I sleep alone,\n\nI cry alone, so...\n\nCool.\n\nDarn. If you weren't busy,\n\nI'd ask you to join us.\n\nReally? I can come? Thanks!\n\nSheldon, are you sure you want to be bringing Raj on your date night with Amy?\n\nOh, absolutely.\n\nI have a contractual obligation to provide Amy with conversation and casual physical contact, but nowhere is it specified that I can't outsource that to an Indian.\n\nHowie?\n\nHowie?\n\nHey, there's my beautiful bride!\n\nCan you see me?\n\nI can.\n\nHow are you?\n\nI'm amazing.\n\nI mean, this is even better than I dreamed.\n\nI look out the window, and... it's all so unbelievable.\n\nGood for you.\n\nI just had a seemingly endless dinner with your mom.\n\nOh, yeah? That's nice.\n\nIt was. Until I found out you never told her we're not gonna live with her.\n\nLet's talk about <i>that</i> for a minute.\n\nHey, look, this pen is floating.\n\nHow crazy is that?\n\nYou said you told her, but you never did!\n\nOkay, okay, I know you're upset, but... let me share something\n\nI've learned since I got here.\n\nYou realize how small your problems are when you're looking down on them from space.\n\nNow, come on, that's got to make you feel better.\n\nHow clear is the image of me on that screen?\n\nPretty clear.\n\nDo I <i>look</i> like I feel better?\n\nI mean, it's not, like,\n\nHD quality.\n\nListen, mister, you're gonna talk to your mother and you're gonna fix this, or that thing I said\n\nI was gonna do to you the minute you got home, you can do to yourself.\n\nLike he's been doing since he got here.\n\nSheldon, this place is so romantic.\n\nOh, I'm glad you like it.\n\nRaj picked it out.\n\nWell, when you see him, tell him I say thank you.\n\nTell him yourself.\n\nYoo-hoo!\n\nOver here!\n\nI don't understand.\n\nWhat's he doing here?\n\nI invited him.\n\nOn our date?\n\nSheldon, that's not okay.\n\nYes, it is.\n\nThere's a loophole in the Relationship Agreement.\n\nYou found a loophole?\n\nSorry I started without you.\n\nI'm a little nervous.\n\nIt's been a long time since I've been on a date.\n\nI can't believe I bleached my mustache for this.\n\nYou should go to my girl.\n\nShe'll knock out those sideburns for free.\n\nYou know, Amy,\n\nI don't even think you and I have had a real conversation.\n\nLet's use tonight to get to know each other a little better.\n\nYou start.\n\nGo home.\n\nI don't understand.\n\nSheldon, how could you do this?\n\nIt's our second anniversary.\n\nIt's your anniversary?!\n\nOh, my God, I had no idea.\n\nAmy, please, let me make this right.\n\nThank you.\n\nMy pleasure.\n\nWaiter?\n\nA bottle of champagne and three glasses.\n\nOh, boy, isn't this romantic?\n\nOh, I hope that's a rhetorical question, because I have no clue.\n\nThis is great.\n\nWhat's the occasion?\n\nNo occasion. You know, things have been a little weird between us, so I wanted to throw together a fun night just for you.\n\nThat is so sweet.\n\nI got all your favorites.\n\nBeer, wings, sliders.\n\nWe can watch the football game.\n\nI even painted my stomach. \"Go sports\"?\n\nWell... in case you were in the mood for baseball,\n\nI didn't want to look ridiculous.\n\nThis is awesome.\n\nI love it!\n\nGood, I'm glad.\n\nGosh, I worked my ass off today.\n\nThis is exactly what I needed.\n\nGreat. Just relax and enjoy.\n\nTonight is all about you.\n\nAh, thank you!\n\nSo, where exactly are we in this relationship?\n\nOh, come on!\n\nI just told you\n\nI had a hard day.\n\nYou're right, I'm sorry.\n\nLet's watch the game.\n\nGreat.\n\nI just know the longer we wait to talk about it, the weirder it gets.\n\nSweetie, can I just be the girl tonight?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nYou're the girl, I'm the guy.\n\nNow, you watch your football game while I make you a little plate here.\n\nThank you!\n\nOh, I'll get it.\n\nGo sports!\n\nHello-lo-lo.\n\nWhat are you doing here?\n\nI thought you were out th Sheldon and Amy.\n\nI was, but it's their anniversary and I didn't want to be a third wheel, so I figured I'd come over here and hang out with you and Penny on your date.\n\nWell, it's not really a great time.\n\nPenny and I have some things we need to talk about.\n\nNo, we don't!\n\nCome on in!\n\nSweet!\n\nI can't believe\n\nI shaved my stomach for this.\n\nHey, Froot Loops.\n\nYou got a phone call.\n\nWho is it?\n\nA woman who says she's your mother but sounds like your father.\n\nHey, Ma.\n\nYou know, we could see each other if you turn on the computer.\n\nI'm not going near that fakakta thing.\n\nI'll catch a computer virus!\n\nYou can't catch a computer virus.\n\nOh, so now you're an astronaut\n\nWhat do you want, Ma?\n\nYour wife says you have something important to tell me.\n\nOkay, here it is.\n\nBernadette and I are starting a life together and...\n\nOh, God!\n\nYou <i>are</i> gonna leave me!\n\nMa...\n\nIt's okay.\n\nYour father left me, you left me--\n\nI guess I'm just the kind of person people like to leave.\n\nIt's not... definite.\n\nI'll talk to Bernadette.\n\nDon't bother.\n\nI'll just go sit in a hole in the ground so I'm no trouble when I die.\n\nStop it, Ma.\n\nI'm sure I can get\n\nBernie to come around.\n\nI knew it!\n\nI knew she was behind this!\n\nYou listen to me, if you want to be a man, you can't let a woman tell you what to do!\n\nOkay, okay.\n\nI can't believe these people won the Cold War.\n\nNow, can we please change the subject?\n\nFine.\n\nYou know, I'm growing to like\n\nAmerican football.\n\nYeah, it's fun, isn't it?\n\nWell... it's not the balls-to-the-wall action of badminton or cricket, but hey... what is?\n\nAll right, who's ready for another beer?\n\nI'm good.\n\nNo, thank you.\n\nGirls.\n\nI am having the nicest time.\n\nYou guys are like family to me.\n\nYou know that, right?\n\nThat's great.\n\nGet out.\n\nWhat? Why?\n\nPenny and I have some issues we need to talk about.\n\nOh... pish on your issues!\n\nYou guys are fine.\n\nYes, you hit some bumps along the way.\n\nI mean, Penny, you've always known how this man has felt about you, but you made him grovel for affection.\n\nOkay, hold on...\n\nNow, don't blame yourself.\n\nHe was a groveler from way back.\n\nBut the point is, the two of you got past it.\n\nAnd, Leonard, you go and propose to this poor girl in the middle of sex?\n\nThat was some weak tea, dude.\n\nSome people might say it was romantic.\n\nYeah, no.\n\nBut yet, here you two are, still together.\n\nAnd that's even after you and I had our crazy naked night.\n\nOkay...\n\nThat's enough.\n\nI'm just saying that after everything you've been through, you get to look into each other's eyes and say \"I love you.\"\n\nAnd that's beautiful.\n\nActually, to this day, she's never really said it.\n\nOh, Penny!\n\nThat's ridiculous!\n\nYou know you love him!\n\nYou look him in the eyes and you say it.\n\nRaj...\n\nOh, come on, you know you want to say it.\n\nSay it.\n\nSay you love him.\n\nSay it!\n\nI really thought she would say it.\n\nHave I ever told you you're like a sexy praying mantis?\n\nEvery time you drink alcohol.\n\nYou know what's wonderful about the praying mantis?\n\nThey devour their mate.\n\nYour point being?\n\nDessert is served.\n\nI just had cobbler.\n\nYou know what?\n\nI'm done with this.\n\nW-Where are you going?\n\nI'm leaving.\n\nYou can't leave.\n\nI need you.\n\nYou do?\n\nYes.\n\nYou're my ride.\n\nSheldon, you either say something meaningful and from the heart, or you and I are done.\n\nAll right.\n\nPlease.\n\nAmy... when I look in your eyes and you're looking back in mine, everything feels not quite normal, because I feel stronger and weaker at the same time.\n\nI feel excited and, at the same time, terrified.\n\nThe truth is,\n\nI don't know what I feel, except...\n\nI know what kind of man\n\nI want to be.\n\nSheldon... that was beautiful.\n\nI should hope so.\n\nThat's from the first\n\nSpider-Man movie.\n\nI'll take it.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, I assume we're splitting the check?\n\nHey, Stuart.\n\nOh, hey. I was actually just about to close up.\n\nOh, I'm sorry. I'll leave.\n\nNo, no. It's okay. Hang out.\n\nYou sure?\n\nYeah, you're my first customer today.\n\nAll right. Great.\n\nI'm, uh, having a nightcap.\n\nYou want to join me?\n\nWhat are you drinking?\n\nCoffee liqueur in a Chewbacca mug.\n\nI call it a sad-tini.\n\nPerfect for the night\n\nI'm having. Thank you.\n\nHmm. Nice not to drink alone.\n\nAmen to that.\n\nSometimes I pour a little chardonnay into my dog's water bowl.\n\nYou're kidding.\n\nShe's kind of a mean drunk, but what are you gonna do?\n\nCheers.\n\nCheers.\n\nA little music?\n\nSure.\n\nMmm. Bossa nova.\n\nYou listen to that with your hips as well as your ears.\n\nMmm.\n\nOh.\n\nSomething about...\n\nLatin music just makes me feel like\n\nI'm on a white sand beach in Rio.\n\nYeah.\n\nThe sun, the waves, the beautiful bodies, tanned and glistening with sweat.\n\nI should go.\n\nYeah.\n\nUh, thank you for the drink.\n\nNo problem.\n\nHey, Stuart.\n\nYeah?\n\nDo you want to... hang out tomorrow night, maybe grab a bite to eat or catch a late movie?\n\nYeah, I-I'd like to, but I'm a little tight on funds.\n\nNo problem. My treat.\n\nI'll swing by after work.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nI could do worse.\n\nHey, I'm a grown man;\n\nI'm gonna live with my wife.\n\nMy mother's just gonna have to learn to make do on her own.\n\nWas she upset?\n\nWho can tell?\n\nShe yells everything.\n\nShe might have been upset.\n\nShe might have been hungry.\n\nThanks for fixing it.\n\nI love you.\n\nI love you, too.\n\nSweet dreams.\n\nI'll talk to you tomorrow?\n\nGood night, Rocket Man.\n\nTo infinity and beyond, baby.\n\nLoops.\n\nYou realize you just lied your ass off to your wife\n\nI know.\n\nWhat are you gonna do when you get back to Earth?\n\nOh, I'm never going back. corrected by \n\nFOLLOW US: <font color=\"#ff0000\">@LIO_OFFICIAL</font>\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "7aeff057-43d0-47d1-a44a-91453f13f4f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "7aeff057-43d0-47d1-a44a-91453f13f4f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "73abac1a347303d79a95c6fa3175ded7b0064db2db991c947a53de3e070d526e", "text": "  \ufeff1\n\nAnd the next wedding gift is... a gravy boat.\n\nOoh, one gravy boat.\n\nThat's from Sheldon.\n\nHe told me he had it engraved. \"In the event of a divorce, please return to Sheldon Cooper.\"\n\nOne \"inappropriate, yet I wish I thought of that\" gravy boat.\n\nWhen I get married\n\nI'm going to register at the UCLA Cadaver Lab.\n\nEw, why?

She just took a sip from his Diet Dr. Pepper.\n\nSo?\n\nSo, if she wants to end her pair-bond with Leonard, why on earth would she guzzle a witches' brew of his soda and spit?\n\nIt's complicated.\n\nString theory is complicated.\n\nThat's just yucky.\n\nDon't get any ideas.\n\nAll right, for the sake of argument, let's say that's true.\n\nWhy doesn't Penny just end the relationship?\n\nShe's not sure how she feels.\n\nHow can she not be sure how she feels?\n\nYou know, when I have a feeling, I know it.\n\nTrains? Love them.\n\nSwordfish?\n\nI love them, too.\n\nThey're fish with a sword for a nose.\n\nRegardless, don't say anything to Leonard.\n\nNow you're asking me to keep a secret from my best friend, colleague, and roommate?\n\nYes, please, Penny will kill me.\n\nFine.\n\nFYI: secret-keeping?\n\nHate it.\n\nHand-holding?\n\nNot a fan.\n\nHammerhead shark?\n\nI love that thing.\n\nYeah, it's another fish with a tool on its head.\n\nRaisinet?\n\nShh, we're trying to watch the movie.\n\nThis is not working out with him.\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\nI think I might have tartar buildup.\n\nMy tongue won't go as far forward as it used to.\n\nMaybe your tongue is shrinking.\n\nNope.\n\nOh, you have no idea how annoying this is.\n\nI'm starting to get a sense of it.\n\nDon't worry. I'll take you to the dentist tomorrow.\n\nThank you.\n\nI appreciate that.\n\nYou're good people, Leonard.\n\nThere's something\n\nI need to tell you.\n\nOkay.\n\nI can't tell you.\n\nWhy?\n\nI can't tell you why I can't tell you.\n\nSo I guess there's two things\n\nI can't tell you.\n\nI wish there were more.\n\nGood night.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nThis is really important.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nI like The Transformers.\n\nDo you like The Transformers?\n\nWhere exactly did your mother have you tested?\n\nLeonard,\n\nThe Transformers teach us that things are not always what they appear to be.\n\nYou know, like, uh, a semi truck might be an alien robot, or, uh, someone in a romantic relationship, uh, might feel differently than they appear to.\n\nOr a conversation about The Transformers might actually be about someone in this room.\n\nI'm going to pause to let that sink in.\n\nOkay, I think I understand.\n\nYou do?\n\nThe guy who seems like an emotionless robot is you... but your relationship with Amy is causing you to transform into a red-blooded man with sexual desires.\n\nThat is literally the stupidest thing I've ever heard.\n\nLeonard?\n\nLeonard.\n\nLeonard?\n\nLEONARD:\n\nWhat?\n\nAre you sleeping?\n\nI was. Now I'm having a nightmare.\n\nWhat do you want?\n\nNever mind.\n\nI still can't tell you.\n\nSHELDON (knocking):\n\nPenny?\n\nMmm.\n\nPenny.\n\nMm-hmm, mmm.\n\nPenny.\n\nOh, my God.\n\nSheldon?\n\nYou frightened me.\n\nWhat are you doing in my bedroom?\n\nYeah, well, I knocked on the front door, but you didn't hear it.\n\nHow did you even get in, you weirdo?\n\nYeah, really?\n\nI've seen strange men traipsing in and out of here for years, but when I do it, it's weird?\n\nWhat do you want, Sheldon?\n\nOh, I was having a little trouble sleeping and I just thought, uh, seeing as you're up, we could talk.\n\nTalk about what?\n\nOh, I don't know.\n\nUh, weather, uh, fish you could do carpentry with.\n\nWhy Leonard is such an attractive and desirable boyfriend.\n\nYeah, pick one-- your choice.\n\nSheldon.\n\nDid you know that Leonard has a perfect driving record and enjoys the insurance discounts that go along with that?\n\nHubba-hubba.\n\nOkay, go home, crazy man.\n\nYeah. Did you know that while Leonard is not considered a tall fellow in our country, in today's North Korea, he's downright average.\n\nTalk about a keeper.\n\nOkay, what did Amy tell you?\n\nOh, very well.\n\nI can't keep up this clever charade any longer.\n\nShe told me that you were thinking of ending it with Leonard.\n\nOkay, you listen to me.\n\nI think it's really sweet you're trying to protect your friend, but this is none of your business. Got it?\n\nExcuse me.

The search is over.\n\nSo, what kind of research are you doing?\n\nHigh-energy lasers.\n\nOoh. Military?\n\nNot yet, but I can remove unwanted hair from two miles away.\n\nYou were right.\n\nI had nothing to worry about.\n\nThat skank's your problem, not mine.\n\nYou're very funny,\n\nDr. Hofstadter.\n\nLEONARD:\n\nThank you.\n\nAah! Cherry stem!\n\nCherry stem!\n\nHow you doing, Howie?\n\nYou feeling a little better?\n\nOh, a lot better, thanks.\n\nOne sec.\n\nListen close.\n\nI don't have a lot of time.\n\nI need you to go to my house.\n\nIn my bedroom, you'll find a model rocket.\n\nI want you to take it and bring it back to your place.\n\nOkay...\n\nStep two: Build a version roughly 14 stories high.\n\nFill it full of rocket fuel and come get me.\n\nI'll leave the door unlocked.\n\nHowie, honey, maybe you should talk to someone, let them know you're having a little anxiety.\n\nNo, no, I'm fine.\n\nNo anxiety!\n\nWe should probably talk in code.\n\nFrom now on, \"frog\" is me, \"sandwich\" means you and \"lemon\" means rocket.\n\nSo, come on, sandwich, build me a lemon 'cause froggy wants to come home!\n\nLook at you, putting on a brave face.\n\nThere's nothing to be brave about.\n\nEverything's fine.\n\nReally?\n\nI don't know how much you know about primate behavior, but Sheldon's assistant was clearly courting Leonard.\n\nWere she a mandrill, she would have bent over and displayed her brightly colored hindquarters like a big red welcome mat.\n\nBy the way, you try that at the junior prom, you get kicked out.\n\nOkay, maybe she <i>was</i> flirting with him, but who cares?\n\nLook, I don't even know where my relationship is with Leonard is right now.\n\nSo says your prefrontal cortex.\n\nBut meanwhile, the limbic system of your brain is calculating that if another woman is attracted to Leonard, it must be because he's desirable.\n\nWell, of course he's desirable.\n\nI mean, he's great.\n\nHe's smart, he's sweet, and, ooh, in the bedroom, whew, let me tell you, he <i>really</i> tries.\n\nSo it does bother you.\n\nFine, it bothers me a little.\n\nNo. You know what?\n\nThis is stupid.\n\nIt doesn't bother me.\n\nOkay, it bothers me.\n\nBut only because she wouldn't stop laughing.\n\nLeonard is not that funny.\n\nAnd there you have it; prefrontal cortex reasoning versus limbic lust.\n\nIf this were a boxing match, they might call it \"The thrilla adjacent to the amygdala.\"\n\nIf you were a brain scientist, you would be busting a gut right now!\n\nSo, how was work today?\n\nAh, it was all right, I guess.\n\nGot to Heimlich a cherry stem out of Sheldon.\n\nCaught Raj right in the eye.\n\nOh!\n\nYou're kidding.\n\nNo, Raj had to go to the nurse.\n\nWow. Anything else?\n\nMmm, the nurse is a woman, so he couldn't talk to her.\n\nShe had to bring him a Grover puppet so he could point at what hurt.\n\nIs that it?\n\nIsn't that enough?\n\nIt had the weaponized fruit and a puppet.\n\nWhat more do you want?\n\nOh, good, Leonard, you're here.\n\nScience news.\n\nThis will interest you.\n\nAnd, Penny, feel free to paint your nails.\n\nWhat do you got?\n\nI believe Alex may have unearthed the grade school science project that could be my ticket to the Nobel Prize.\n\nBehold. \"Magnets: What Do\n\nThey Stick To?\"\n\nIf the answer is \"metal,\" it's not exactly groundbreaking.\n\nThe original title was \"A Rederivation of Maxwell's Equations\n\nRegarding Electromagnetism\"\"\n\nI dumbed it down because some of the more religious people in town were starting to say I was a witch.\n\nSheldon thinks the approach in this paper might change the way we calculate ferromagnetic hysteresis.\n\nOh, it's about time.\n\nI hated the old way.\n\nHi. I'm Penny.\n\nAlex.\n\nUh, do you work with Dr. Hofstadter?\n\nIn a way.\n\nWe've kind of been involved in a five-year experiment.\n\nOh. Well, you're lucky.\n\nHe seems very talented.\n\nAnd I'm sure a lot of people want to work with him.\n\nWell, a lot of people can't.\n\nUh, hey.\n\nWhere are we going?\n\nMy limbic system wants to take your pants off.\n\nShe seems nice.\n\nNotice people on your own time.\n\nWe're working.\n\nHey, Howie, how you feeling?\n\nBetter.

sake, he's wearing a hat, glasses, and a red striped shirt.\n\nI know what he looks like.\n\nOh, there he is, I got him.\n\nYes, we win again!\n\nHow could you not find him?\n\nBecause he's hard to

to get to see you until tomorrow.\n\nYeah, well,\n\nBernadette's a little under the weather and my mom's kind of under my dentist.\n\nWait, your, your mother is sleeping with your dentist?\n\nFormer dentist.\n\nI need a new one now that I know where his hands have been.\n\nSo you're wandering all around by yourself?\n\nThat's not the kind of hero's welcome an astronaut should come home to.\n\nIt's okay, you know, we space cowboys don't do what we do for glory and fame.\n\nWe leave that to your rock stars and your athletes and your Howie Mandels.\n\nOh, hey, man, welcome back.\n\nOh, Stuart, thanks.\n\nWhat are you doing here?\n\nI, I kind of live here now.\n\nJust until he gets back on his feet, which are looking pretty good in the boots I bought him for his birthday.\n\nAh, he's spoiling me and I love it.\n\nWow, so you guys are like buds now?\n\nOh, yeah, we hang out all the time.\n\nPlus, he doesn't have a girlfriend,\n\nI don't have a girlfriend.\n\nIt's like we both had these holes in our lives, but now we fill each other's holes.\n\nUh... that sounds a little funny to an American ear.\n\nWhich part?\n\nJust all of it.\n\nOkay, so w-what do you guys got going on tonight?\n\nRaj is taking me to the\n\nThat used to be our thing, but that's cool.\n\nOh, Howard, it's still our thing.\n\nCome with us, we'll, we'll get you a scalped ticket.\n\nSo I'd be sitting by myself?\n\nWe'll switch.\n\nYou'll come sit with me after intermission.\n\nSo I-I-I'd be sitting by myself during \"Edelweiss\"?\n\nNo, no, you guys go.\n\nHave fun.\n\nOkay, uh, will I get to see you tomorrow?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nSee you, Stuart.\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nIs he taller?\n\nAt least my mother made <i>her</i> boyfriend climb out the window.\n\nAll right, standard state fair pie-eating contest rules are: no hands, first one to clean the pan wins.\n\nOn the count of three.\n\nOne, two...\n\nWait.\n\nI'm a little concerned.\n\nBlueberries are rich in antioxidants.\n\nSo?\n\nSo, with all those antioxidants, what if I run out of oxidants?\n\nSheldon, we haven't won a game all night.\n\nNow, you either stick your face in that pie or I'm gonna stick that pie in your face.\n\nThat's

I find that inconsistent with everything I know about you.\n\nOh, oh, on the contrary.\n\nCouples costumes are one of the few benefits of being in a relationship.\n\nNow imagine this: you and I entering\n\nStuart's party and all eyes turn to see\n\nAmerica's most beloved and glamorous couple.\n\nYeah?\n\nR2-D2 and C-3PO!\n\nDibs on 3PO.\n\nSheldon, when I said couples costume,\n\nI meant like Romeo and Juliet or Cinderella and Prince Charming, not two robots from some silly movie I don't even like.\n\nOkay!\n\nI'm gonna let that slide because I kn you're hopped up on tea bags.\n\nI make compromises for you all the time.\n\nJust this once, can't we find something that we're both happy with?\n\nFine.

What's going on in here?\n\nOh, no, no, no, don't look in there.\n\nWhat, is it secret?\n\nNo, it's a nitrogen laser.\n\nIt'll cook your eyeball like a soft-boiled egg.\n\nOh. You might want to put a sign on it.\n\nSign right there.\n\nAh. \"Danger,\" sure, sure.\n\nYeah. What's, what's that?\n\nUh, that is an integrated ion trap and time-of-flight mass spectrometer.\n\nWow. High-techie-techie.\n\nWhat's this little box?\n\nThat is a pencil sharpener.\n\nOoh, low-techie-techie.\n\nSo, what are you working on right now?\n\nIt's actually pretty neat.\n\nYeah?\n\nYeah. It's a front-projected holographic display combined with laser-based finger tracking.\n\nHere, I'll show you.\n\nWe'll just put this pencil over here.\n\nSharp. Thanks to the machine we saw earlier.\n\nVery good.\n\nAnd then a laser will map the reflective surface... and voil\u00e0.\n\nWow. That is amazing.\n\nYou know, there's a foundational idea in string theory that the whole universe may be a hologram.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nOh!\n\nWow.\n\nUh-huh.\n\nWell, the holographic principle suggests that what we all experience every day in three dimensions may really just be information on a surface located at the farthest reaches of our cosmos.\n\nSo it's possible that our lives are really just acting out a painting on the largest canvas in the universe.\n\nHmm.\n\nWhat?\n\nSometimes I forget how smart you are.\n\nYou should visit more often.\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\nTake off your clothes.\n\nWhat? Here? Now?\n\nYeah. You got a problem with that?\n\nNo, no. It's kind of crazy.\n\nI've never fooled around in the lab before.\n\nReally? Never?\n\nNo. I did have a shot with the Lisatronic, but the extension cord wasn't long enough.\n\nBefore I forget, I'd like your opinion on the menus\n\nI've prepared for the Halloween party.\n\nThe theme is \"food that goes bump in the night.\" \"Creature from the Black Forest Ham Lagoon.\"\n\nOn Sesame seed Bunzillas. \"Night of the Living\n\nGarlic Bread\"?\n\nIt's funny because \"bread\" sounds like \"dead\".\n\nI'm sorry, but these are just ordinary foods with the names bent into tortured puns.\n\nThe dishes themselves are in no way Halloweenie.\n\nOoh, Hallow-weenies!\n\nThat's a good one.\n\nThey'll pair nicely with my \"Draculoni and Cheese.\"\n\nHow do I do it?!\n\nThat reminds me, I was thinking about wearing my NASA jumpsuit as a costume.\n\nBut then I realized everyone would be, like, \"Where's your costume?\n\nWhy are you wearing your work clothes, you nut?\"\n\nHello, boys.\n\nWhat are you smiling at?\n\nNothing.\n\nYou know where's there's a lot of nothing.\n\nSpace.\n\nBoy, it's nice to sleep in a bed with gravity again.\n\nDid I tell you about the night my retainer floated out of my mouth and into the air lock?\n\nYeah, you mentioned it once or twice.\n\nSo, here we are, just a couple of young newlyweds.\n\nWhat to do?\n\nWhat to do to you?\n\nAstronaut Wolowitz, reporting for booty.\n\nPreparing thrusters.\n\nWe have liftoff.\n\nAre we clear to jettison that nightgown?\n\nOkay, we need to talk.\n\nWhat?\n\nHowie, I know you went to space.\n\nI'm incredibly proud of you.\n\nBut you might want to try and not bring it up every minute.\n\nI don't talk about it every minute.\n\nTonight at dinner you went on about it for an hour straight.\n\nWhat was I supposed to talk about?\n\nWe were eating at Johnny Rockets.\n\nI'm just saying, people are getting a little tired of it.\n\nSo, I did this amazing thing and I'm never allowed to mention it?\n\nOf course you can.\n\nBut maybe a good rule would be to wait for people to bring it up.\n\nOkay, no problem.\n\nIt won't happen again.\n\nI love you.\n\nI love you, too.\n\nI can't tell you how many times I dreamed\n\nI was in bed here with you when I was... you know.\n\nWhat, I can't even point?\n\nSo, basically, this is what's called mag-lev technology.\n\nIt uses very powerful electromagnets to create a force strong enough to overcome gravity.\n\nHere, you hold this.\n\nWhoa! That's heavy.\n\nYeah. Oh, uh, you don't have on any jewelry, do you?\n\nNo. Why?\n\nA grad student forgot to take out one of his piercings.\n\nNow he's on a transplant list waiting for a nipple his size.\n\nNow watch this.\n\nWhoa!\n\nThat is very cool.\n\nSometimes I like to turn this on and pretend I'm the super villain Magneto.\n\nIt's getting a little less cool, Leonard.\n\nBut what I really am is a very smart scientist who understands the mechanics of the universe and is wearing the sexy black underwear you bought him.\n\nThere we go.\n\nSo, I thought the photo booth for the party could either be creepy like a mummy's tomb, or they also have the Tardis from <i>Doctor Who.</i>\n\nA Tardis makes no sense.\n\nIt's a time machine from a science-fiction show.\n\nIt has nothing to do with Halloween.\n\nThat being said, if you don't get a Tardis, you stink and your party stinks.\n\nDo you have a preference?\n\nI don't care. Get the Tardis.\n\nYes!

Now...\n\nI know Hawking's not busy because I can see he's playing other people right now.\n\nMaybe since you're so good, he's taking his time to meet the challenge.\n\nI want Penny to enjoy school...\n\nWolowitz told me he's a big baby!\n\nBut I didn't know that, and I played \"extract\" for 82 points.\n\nIt's all Amy's fault.\n\nShe told me to play it.\n\nI have got to cut her loose.\n\nSheldon, I wasn't done talking.\n\nShe hands in the paper tomorrow.\n\nI know I could help her.\n\nAnd she's my girlfriend...\n\nI-I should be allowed to help her.\n\nWhy aren't I allowed to help her?\n\nYeah, I hear you, brother.\n\nNo.\n\nYou need to give me some advice.\n\nFine.

Amy, how are your lady parts?\n\nStill chilly down there?\n\nHang on.\n\nNone of Sheldon's theories have ever been definitively proven.\n\nMy husband actually went to outer space.\n\nThat's an impressive accomplishment.\n\nHe's now an inspiration to millions of Americans who know you don't have to be special or even qualified to go into space.\n\nYou know, I remember the first time I got a bikini wax.\n\nMy sister did it with melted\n\nCrayolas and duct tape.\n\nIt's a bad idea...\n\nGosh, Amy.\n\nI'm sensing a little hostility.\n\nIs it maybe because, like Sheldon's work, your sex life is also theoretical?\n\nDamn.\n\nYeah, well, at least when we do make love,\n\nSheldon won't be thinking about his mother.\n\nAnd yes, that is a cleverly veiled reference to Howard's lifelong obsession to crawl back into her spacious womb.\n\nAnyway, to this day,\n\nI still can't see a box of crayons without crossing my legs.\n\nI don't have to take this.\n\nI'm gonna go home and have sex with my husband right now.\n\nMaybe I'll let him do it to me in the parking spot.\n\nWhich sounds dirty, but I didn't mean it that way!\n\nOkay, here's another one:\n\nIf a zombie bites a vampire, and the vampire bites a human, does the human become a vampire or a zombie?\n\nOr a zompire?\n\nSheldon?\n\nCookie.\n\nI don't have any.\n\nWell, I'm not giving it away.\n\nWOLOWITZ:\n\nHi, Sheldon.\n\nHe's in my spot.\n\nLeonard, make him stop being naked in my spot. what are you doing?\n\nHe wasn't using it.\n\nAnd I needed a nice cool piece of leather to wiggle my naked ass on.\n\nGet off there.\n\nGive me back my Iron Man helmet.\n\nGive me back my parking space.\n\nYou don't need a parking space.\n\nYou don't have a car.\n\nYou don't need an Iron Man helmet.\n\nYou're not Iron Man.\n\nWell, we appear to have reached an impasse.\n\nAnd you know,\n\nI have to say, I thought you'd be more upset that your laptop is sitting on my junk.\n\nI didn't pick up on that.\n\nThat's a nice touch.\n\nThis is so exciting.\n\nI'm feeling all tingly.\n\nAlthough that could just be my newly defoliated bikini zone.\n\nKeep a lookout.\n\nThis place is swarming with campus security.\n\nThey will not hesitate to scold us.\n\nFreaking pigs.\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nOkay, now, pull your car into the spot and let's get out of here.\n\nWait, I'm leaving my car here?\n\nYes, and be sure and put on the emergency brake.\n\nReally makes these things tough to budge.\n\nBefore I park, come in the backseat.\n\nI want to show you something\n\nI had done today.\n\nAll right, color me intrigued.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nI think you're high on paint fumes.\n\nAnd boy, that's a lot of Band-Aids.\n\nOkay, Howard's mother is in, like, every one of your wedding photos.\n\nWhat can I tell ya?\n\nShe's a big girl.\n\nWherever you look, there she is.\n\nMore coffee?\n\nNo, Leonard's taking me to a physics lecture, and coffee'll just keep me awake.\n\nOh, I'll get it.\n\nOh, looks like someone's on\n\nTeam Bernadette.\n\nWhere's Howard?\n\nHe's not here. What's wrong?\n\nHe had my car towed.\n\nIt cost me $200 to get it back.\n\nOh, no.\n\nWhere was it parked?\n\nIn Sheldon's spot.\n\nThat doesn't make sense.\n\nSheldon doesn't have a spot.\n\nWas it maybe in Howard's spot?\n\nDon't play dumb with me, sister.\n\nYou tell your husband he owes me $200.\n\nWell, that doesn't make sense, either.\n\nWhy not?\n\nBecause I'm the one who had it towed.\n\nYou?\n\nDidn't see that one coming, did ya?\n\nOh, yeah?\n\nWell, you're not gonna see this coming.\n\nOh, my God, are you okay?!\n\nWhat the hell do you have in there?!\n\nJust my wallet, keys and a coffee can full of change\n\nI've been meaning to take to the bank.\n\nDon't move.\n\nI'll get some ice.\n\nAre you okay?\n\nGet away from me or I swear to God\n\nI will rip out what's left of your pubes!\n\nHere.\n\nThanks. Ah!\n\nAmy, you think maybe this has gotten a little out of hand?\n\nGee, you think?!\n\nI do.\n\nPenny, Bernadette and I are sorry.\n\nYou hit her! What did I do?\n\nYou had my car towed.\n\nYou were parked in\n\nHoward's spot!\n\nI was parked in Sheldon's spot!\n\nSheldon doesn't have a spot!\n\nGuys, I think I need to go to the emergency room.\n\nOkay, let's go.\n\nI'll drive.\n\nYou can see where the tow truck scratched my car.\n\nThe tow truck didn't scratch your car.\n\nHow do you know? 'Cause I did it!\n\nMorning, Professor Stevens.\n\nDon't look at that whiteboard.\n\nThat's my math, not your math.\n\nKeep walking, nosey.\n\nWhat the hell are you doing?\n\nOh...\n\nYou said I'm not using my space, so... I'm using it.\n\nOkay, you need to move now.\n\nNo, I don't.\n\nYou can't stay there forever.\n\nActually, I have a plastic baggy strapped to my leg that says I can.\n\nGive up, Wolowitz.\n\nYou've chosen to tangle with a superior intellect you can't defeat.\n\nThere is nothing you could possibly do to...\n\nThose aren't gonna help you,\n\nSheldon!\n\nOh, yes, they are!\n\nI mean, what?!\n\nI'm warning you, Sheldon!\n\nYour threats are empty!\n\nNothing can move me!\n\nStop that!\n\nGet out of my spot!\n\nThat's it.\n\nI am calling campus security!\n\nYou prepare for the scolding of your life!\n\nWhat are you idiots doing?!\n\nHe's trying to kill me, Leonard!\n\nVideo games and rock music have desensitized him to violence!\n\nWould you please talk some sense into your lunatic roommate?\n\nYou're both acting like lunatics.\n\nIt's just a parking spot.\n\nIt's not just a parking spot!\n\nHe can't handle the fact that\n\nI'm a bigger deal than he is now.\n\nOh, preposterous!\n\nI have been solely responsible for this university's six-loop quantum gravity calculations;\n\nI have changed the way we think about Bose-Einstein condensates, and I am also the one who got Nutter Butters in the cafeteria vending machine.\n\nMaybe you missed that news while you were floating around like a goof in outer space.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me,\n\nI have work to do.\n\nCan you believe this guy?\n\nWhat I don't believe is that you tried to run him over.\n\nOh, like you've never thought of doing that.\n\nDon't hate me just because\n\nI lived the dream.\n\nHey.\n\nSweet ride!\n\nWhat are you doing in there?!\n\nJust breaking in your new car.\n\nStop that!\n\nYou stop that!\n\nYou know what they say?\n\nRevenge is a dish best served nude.\n\nHey, got a minute?\n\nOh, of course, come in.\n\nThis is an authentic Chinese throwing star, and I must warn you,\n\nI have seen many people throw them in movies.\n\nCalm down.\n\nHoward has something he wants to say to you.\n\nWOLOWITZ:\n\nAll right.\n\nSheldon, when this whole thing with the parking space started,\n\nI had no idea just how much of a crazy bastard...\n\nHoward... that's not how we practiced it.\n\nI had no idea how much that spot meant to you.\n\nAnyway, I called\n\nPresident Siebert and told him it's not worth fighting over the spot, so you keep it, and I'll park in the structure across the street.\n\nWell, Howard, thank you.\n\nIt's quite a gesture on your part.\n\nYou've shown yourself to be the bigger man.\n\nThank you.\n\nWhich I find totally unacceptable.\n\nI must be the bigger man.\n\nTherefore, you may use my spot until such time as I learn to drive or get a Batmobile.\n\nWow, okay.\n\nWell, thanks.\n\nI don't know what to say.\n\nThere is nothing to say.\n\nExcept I'm the bigger man.\n\nI'm not kidding. Say it.\n\nJust say it.\n\nYou're the bigger man, Sheldon.\n\nOh, stop.\n\nAnd I believe this is yours.\n\nFYI, if you wear that into a bank, they will tackle you to the ground.\n\nI'd like to propose a toast-- to burying the hatchet.\n\nTo burying the hatchet.\n\nYou know, I'm kind of glad this happened.\n\nMe, too.\n\nIn some weird way, I kind of feel like it brought us closer.\n\nYeah, everybody's happy.\n\nGreat!\n\nCan I help you?\n\nYes.

Howard, what do you do?\n\nI follow the ogre tracks, checking for secret doors along the way.\n\nAnd you discover a secret door leading to a dark corridor.\n\nOkay, guys, let's make a plan: spell casters in the back, warriors in the front...\n\nNo, screw that noise,\n\nI'm going in.\n\nHang on, Santa,\n\nI'm coming for you!\n\nOkay, you run into a room full of weapons, hit a trip wire... ...a cannon blows your face off, you die, you're out of the game.\n\nBut... a canon?\n\nAm I really out of the game?\n\nLucky.\n\nOkay, come on, moving on.\n\nWait, doesn't anyone have a roof resurrection?\n\nBecause if you've got one, I need it bad.\n\nGet in here with your rod and give it to me.\n\nOkay, you need to say these things in your head before you say them out loud.\n\nHey, guys.\n\nI don't mean to interrupt your little game, but I thought you'd like to see what you're missing out on.\n\nSo...\n\nBernadette?\n\nBernadette's wearing leopard-print pumps and a rack-tastic red dress from Forever 21.\n\nSubtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org\n\nAnd there's Amy, showing all kinds of ankle.\n\nIn an outfit I'm assuming is from Forever 63.\n\nAnd I, myself... ...am wearing a little number that got me out of two speeding tickets and jury duty.\n\nI know they're making a rhetorical point,\n\nI just don't know what it is.\n\nSee you, boys. We are going drinking.\n\nUh, wait, can I come with you?\n\nMy character died.\n\nSorry, Raj, it's girls' night out.\n\nMaybe another time.\n\nOkay...\n\nCome on.\n\nOoh!\n\nGirls' night, girls' night!\n\nHow does he not hear that?\n\nSo, what's the plan?\n\nAre we gonna teach our fellas a lesson by getting stinking drunk, luring strange men into the bathroom, and turning the toilet stall into a temple of the senses?\n\nNo!\n\nNo!\n\nGeez, who's Forever 63 now?\n\nCan we get another bottle of champagne for the table?\n\nDon't worry.\n\nIt's my treat.\n\nThanks.\n\nWow!\n\nYou should come to girls' night more often.\n\nAnd not just because if you weren't here, this would be a can of Pabst.\n\nMy pleasure; nothing makes me happier than the chance to spoil a lady.\n\nJust ask my dog.\n\nMy vet says if I give her any more foie gras, she's going to die of gout.\n\nHey, let's help Raj meet a girl tonight.\n\nNo, no, no, I'm fine.\n\nOkay, wait, are we talking one-night stand or do we want to get him into a relationship?\n\nLet's get him laid!\n\nStop it.\n\nYou're ruining girls' night.\n\nRaj, you're a great guy, you're in a bar full of single women; let us help you.\n\nYeah, you're a real catch.\n\nI know you're shy, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't have someone wonderful in your life.\n\nThat's sweet of you.\n\nBut what can you do to help?\n\nWe'll nose around, see if we can find a nice girl, and then introduce you.\n\nOkay.\n\nWell, a couple of things.\n\nDon't tell them\n\nI come from money.\n\nI want them to love me for me.\n\nThey must be insanely hot.\n\nLike, nines or tens.\n\nNines or tens?\n\nOkay, an eight is acceptable if she's willing to bring another eight to the hot tub.\n\nBottom line: you'll take any woman who'll have you, right?\n\nIn a New Delhi minute.\n\nI don't remember you buying these miniatures in my store.\n\nOh, uh, yeah.\n\nI got 'em on Amazon.\n\nSure. I get it.\n\nWhy support a friend when you can support a multinational conglomerate that is crushing the life out of that friend?\n\nI know, but when I shop online,\n\nI can do it on the toilet.\n\nHave you seen my store?\n\nThe whole place is a toilet.\n\nC-Can we please move this along?\n\nYeah, sorry.\n\nUh, you come to the end of the tunnel and find a large chest.\n\nWhat do you do?\n\nAnd, Howard, do not say, \"I feel up the large chest.\"\n\nExcuse me,\n\nI'm a married man now.\n\nI wasn't going to say anything so juvenile.\n\nGreat. What do you do?\n\nI walk up to the large chest, bury my face in it and go.\n\nI open the chest.\n\nIt's locked, but suddenly the door behind you slams shut and now the walls of the room start closing in.\n\nThat's not good.\n\nMy character and I both have claustrophobia.\n\nGlowing letters appear on the chest that read, \"If squashed to death you wish not to be, sing of Svaty Vaclav and his victory.\"\n\nWho the hell is Svaty Vaclav?\n\nWalls are getting closer.\n\nOh, boy, happy place, happy place.\n\nWait, Svaty Vaclav was the Duke of Bohemia.\n\nYou're ten seconds away from getting crushed!\n\nNine, eight...\n\nWhat are we supposed to do? ...seven, six...\n\nWait, wait.\n\nSvaty Vaclav is better known as Good King Wenceslas from the beloved\n\nVictorian Christmas carol.\n\nNever heard of it.\n\nMust be the one Christmas song not written by a Jewish guy. ...three, two...\n\nSomebody sing the damn song! \u266a Good King Wenceslas looked out \u266a \u266a On the feast of Stephen \u266a When the snow lay 'round about \u266a \u266a Deep and crisp and even\n\nThe walls are getting slower. \u266a Brightly shone the moon that night \u266a \u266a Though the frost was cru-el \u266a \u266a When a poor man came in sight \u266a \u266a Gath'ring winter fu-el\n\nThe walls stop! You're safe!\n\nThat was amazing, Sheldon.\n\nHow did you know that?\n\nIt was simple.\n\nI combined a well-known, historical fact about Bohemia with the memory of my grandparents,\n\nMee-Maw and Pop-Pop, singing Christmas carols while I sat in front of the fire and tried to build a high-energy particle accelerator out of Legos.\n\nOkay, continuing our quest.\n\nW-W-Wait.\n\nThere's still four more verses.\n\nYou don't sing a song and not finish it. \u266a Hither, page, and stand by me \u266a \u266a If thou know'st it, telling \u266a \u266a Yonder peasant, who is he? \u266a Where and what his dwelling? \u266a Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost... \u266a\n\nLooks like he's doing pretty good.\n\nOf course he is.\n\nLook, that girl just got dumped by her boyfriend.\n\nShe's angry, she's drunk, and her favorite movie is <i>Slumdog Millionaire.</i>\n\nI mean...\n\nThat is some low-hanging fruit.\n\nOh, here he comes.\n\nSo, how'd it go?\n\nGreat.\n\nI bought her a couple of drinks, and she gave me her e-mail address.\n\nOoh! \"Jennifer@not-even-if-you-were- the-last-guy-on-earth.loser\"\"\n\nWhat?\n\nI'm sorry, Raj.\n\nWhy can't I find someone?\n\nI'm smart, I've got a cool job, and my naturally bronzed complexion means I can pull off mustard yellow in a way most guys can't.\n\nOh, honey, it's not you, it's them.\n\nNo, it's not.\n\nShe was too beautiful for me.\n\nWhy would you say that?\n\nIt's true.\n\nI'm always attracted to women I can't have.\n\nI do it all the time.\n\nI did the same thing with the two of you.\n\nThe two of them?\n\nI don't understand.\n\nWell, uh, there was a time when I had a thing for Penny, and I thought she was into me, too, because she got drunk and naked and climbed into bed with me.\n\nBut apparently\n\nI misread those signals.\n\nAnd you liked Bernadette also?\n\nThat was before Penny.\n\nI make it a rule to only fall for one of my friends' girlfriends at a time.\n\nI'm very old-fashioned that way.\n\nSo at, uh, some point, you probably had a thing for me, too.\n\nNo, not really.\n\nOh, come on, Raj, not even a little bit?\n\nNot that I can think of.\n\nThink harder.\n\nNope.\n\nI guess the heart wants what the heart wants.\n\nOr in this case, doesn't.\n\nI mean, at all.\n\nWhat? \u266a Ye who now will bless the poor \u266a \u266a Shall yourselves find blessing \u266a \u266a Ba-da-bum.\n\nDone?\n\nI think the word you're looking for is \"bravo.\"\n\nOkay, you leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen.\n\nMelted snowmen?\n\nAre there carrots and lumps of coal in the water?\n\nI don't know.\n\nWhat's the difference?\n\nIt's a game of the imagination, Leonard.\n\nPaint a picture.\n\nFine.\n\nYou leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen.\n\nThere are carrots and lumps of coal in the water.\n\nWhat happened to the top hats and the corncob pipes?\n\nYou see those, too.\n\nOh, it's like I'm really there.\n\nI gotta tell you, this-this is the most holiday fun I've had since my therapist changed my anxiety medication and I stopped caring about the blood in my stool.\n\nGood story.\n\nWhat are you drinking there?\n\nLittle eggnog?\n\nYes.\n\nWhat, is there a problem?\n\nNo, it's nice to see you enjoying a holiday beverage.\n\nPretty Christmasy.\n\nSince when is eggnog a Christmas drink?\n\nEggs are available all year 'round.\n\nI've been known to enjoy this poolside.\n\nCome on, Sheldon.\n\nYou know all the Christmas stories, and the carols, you've got an eggnog mustache going on there.\n\nJust admit it.\n\nYou're getting a little Yuletide spirit.\n\nOh, don't be silly.\n\nChristmas is a bunch of baloney created by the tinsel industry.\n\nWhy is this so important to you?\n\nHonestly, because I had enough crappy Christmases as a kid and I'm tired of you sucking the joy out of them now.\n\nWhat was so bad about them?\n\nI grew up in a house full of crazy academics.\n\nInstead of leaving Santa milk and cookies, we had to leave him a research paper.\n\nAnd in the morning, you could tell he'd been there because the paper would be graded.\n\nNo wonder you love Christmas.\n\nThat sounds amazing.\n\nIt wasn't amazing.\n\nI got a C-minus four years in a row.\n\nYeah, I'm familiar with your work.\n\nC-minus was your gift.\n\nAmy, I'm really sorry.\n\nI didn't mean to upset you.\n\nIt's fine.\n\nI'm used to being the girl who never gets looked at twice.\n\nI didn't have my first kiss till I was 22, and the guy only did it so\n\nI'd give him back his insulin.\n\nSometimes the pancreas wants what the pancreas wants.\n\nForget it.\n\nI don't expect you guys to understand.\n\nI understand.\n\nIn seventh grade,\n\nI played Spin the Bottle and it landed on Alina Shankar.\n\nShe said if I came near her, she would break the bottle and cut me.\n\nYou think that's bad?\n\nIn college, I passed out at a frat party and woke up with more clothes on.\n\nSometimes I get so lonely,\n\nI sit on my left hand until it goes numb, then I put it in my right hand and pretend\n\nI'm holding hands with another person.\n\nI do that, too.\n\nSometimes the left hand tries to cop a feel.\n\nAnd I let it.\n\nIt's kind of nice to talk to someone who understands what it feels like to be alone.\n\nIt is, isn't it?\n\nBut you're not alone anymore.\n\nNow you've got Sheldon.\n\nI do.\n\nAnd don't worry, someday you'll have somebody, too.\n\nThank you.\n\nI hope she's half as lovely and amazing as you are.\n\nThank you, Rajesh.\n\nHe wants me, I'm good.\n\nWe can go now.\n\nDamn it.\n\nWhat?\n\nNow that I know she doesn't like me,\n\nI'm kind of into her.\n\nAll right.\n\nI think I cracked the code to lower the drawbridge.\n\nGreat.\n\nLet's do it.\n\nThe drawbridge is lowering.\n\nMy carpal tunnel's acting up.\n\nPlay through the pain!\n\nYou did it!\n\nThe drawbridge is down.\n\nYou cross the chasm and find yourself in a small dungeon room.\n\nAnd in the corner, chained to the wall, you see a bloodied and beaten\n\nSanta Claus.\n\nHe says, \"Ho, ho, help me.\"\n\nYes, we found Santa!\n\nChristmas is saved!\n\nDon't ever tell my mother I said that.\n\nI take out my skeleton key and run to Santa to unchain him.\n\nBut first, I cast a spell of paralysis on Stuart and Howard.\n\nWait, what are you doing?\n\nYou can't talk; you're paralyzed.\n\nI get right up in Santa's big, fat face and say...\n\nWell, well, well, jolly old Saint Nick, we meet again.\n\nYeah, I believe the last time we spoke was in the Baybrook Mall in Galveston, Texas, when I was five years old, isn't that right?\n\nUh, okay.\n\nMy mother dragged me there and she plopped me down on your lap and you asked me what I wanted for Christmas.\n\nAnd I told you \"my Pop-Pop,\" because that was the year my grandfather died.\n\nI missed him and I wanted him back.\n\nThis is weird, right?\n\nPop-Pop was the only one in my family who encouraged me to pursue science.\n\nBut you didn't bring him back, did you?\n\nInstead, I got Lincoln Logs.\n\nWell, you can build a lot of neat things out of Lincoln Logs, but Pop-Pop ain't one of 'em.\n\nAnd now you're here asking me for something-- to save you.\n\nWell, sorry, Mr. Kringle, but today's not your day.\n\nI'm leaving you here to rot, and I hope the ogres feast on your bones.\n\nI take the skeleton key, and I toss it into the chasm, and on the way out, I give Santa a swift kick in his bowl full of jelly!\n\nOkay.\n\nSo Wolowitz and Stuart are paralyzed, Santa's dead, and I picked this over having sex with my girlfriend.\n\nSanta?\n\nOh, hello, Sheldon.\n\nYou should be asleep.\n\nWell, then, you shouldn't have jingle bells on your boots.\n\nOh...\n\nI've been wanting to talk to you.\n\nI'm sorry I disappointed you when you were a little boy.\n\nI-I can do a lot of magical things, but unfortunately bringing your\n\nPop-Pop back isn't one of them.\n\nI understand.\n\nBut I-I do have something special for you.\n\nClose your eyes.\n\nOh, I hope it's a train.\n\nOh, it's better than a train.\n\nTwo trains?\n\nBetter.\n\nI'm getting three trains.\n\nOkay, open 'em.\n\nThis is for leaving me in the dungeon to be eaten alive by ogres!\n\nWait, uh, uh, hang on.\n\nI-In my defense...\n\nHo, ho, ho, ya big dork! == sync, corrected by <font

No. This is\n\nTondelaya della Ventimiglia.\n\nWait, what the hell's going on with Leonard and Alex?  No,\n\nI'm sorry. Who's talking about Leonard and Alex?\n\nW...\n\nFine. Ricardo and Tondelaya.\n\nOkay, look, it's not really about Ricardo and Tondelaya.\n\nIt is really about her boss, who doesn't quite know how to handle this situation and could use your advice, which is surprising because\n\nDr. Einstein Von Brainstorm...\n\nHe's usually pretty smart about these things.\n\nI'm gonna kill her.\n\nI'm sure you've got nothing to worry about.\n\nLeonard would never cheat on you.\n\nShe's right.\n\nBut say the word--\n\nI got a lab full of cocaine-addicted monkeys with nothing to lose.\n\nOne of them could end up in the backseat of her car.\n\nOr her shower.\n\nLadies, ladies, please.\n\nWe're not here to talk about Penny, okay?\n\nWe're here to talk about me.\n\nUh, I mean Einstein\n\nVon Brainst... Oh, darn it!\n\nAll right, I guess the cat's out of the bag.\n\nLet me explain what's going on-- Ricardo is really\n\nLeonard...\n\nWe know what's going on, Sheldon!\n\nWell, what should I do?\n\nWell, Alex is your employee.\n\nIf she's doing something that's making Leonard uncomfortable, you should talk to her.\n\nOh, no, he's not uncomfortable at all.\n\nNo, he's loving it.\n\nYeah, he's strutting around like he's five-foot-six.\n\nWhat... He's loving it?\n\nSheldon, you need to talk to Alex right away.\n\nTalk to her?\n\nThat's all you've got?\n\nWith a cool name like Sheldon\n\nCooper's Council of Ladies,\n\nI really expected more.\n\nGive me back the T-shirts.\n\nAlex... check my schedule.\n\nWhat does my afternoon look like?\n\nI think it's pretty wide open.\n\nOh, wait.\n\nHere's something at 4:00. \"Give Alex a talking to\"?\n\nWell, that snuck up on us, didn't it?\n\nIs there a problem?\n\nLet's not call it a problem.\n\nLet's call it an opportunity.\n\nTo solve a serious problem.\n\nWhat did I do?\n\nYou don't know?\n\nOh, you poor dear.\n\nYour ovaries are squirting so much goofy juice into your brains you don't even know which way is up.\n\nYou made an inappropriate sexual advance towards Dr. Hofstadter.\n\nWhat? I didn't make a sexual advance on anybody.\n\nNow, there's no need to get defensive.\n\nI'm not unsympathetic to your plight.\n\nMy father used to say that a woman is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm Texas day.\n\nWhat?\n\nFull of eggs and only appealing for a short time.\n\nThis conversation is making me uncomfortable.\n\nYeah, you and me both, sister.\n\nNow, please understand...\n\nI don't hold you responsible for your behavior because, see, from an evolutionary standpoint, you're a slave to your desire to reproduce.\n\nBut during the work day, when you feel possessed by amorous intent, may I suggest that you suppress it by leafing through this illustrated book of sexually transmitted diseases?\n\nLet's see here.\n\nOh, yes.\n\nCheck out this oozy doozy.\n\nI have to go.\n\nSo does this fellow, but he can't without it burning like hot soup.\n\nHey, pretty lady.\n\nOh, you seem extra happy.\n\nUh, I guess I am.\n\nAny particular reason why?\n\nMm, I don't know, just having a good day.\n\nThis morning Sheldon fell asleep on the way to work, so I got to listen to the radio-- that was pretty crazy.\n\nMm-hmm. Anything else?\n\nMm. I found this quiz online called \"Which Star Trek\n\nCharacter Are You?\" and it only took me four tries to get Captain Kirk.\n\nThat's great.\n\nOh. It. Was.\n\nHmm. Well, I'm glad you're having such a great day.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd the one thing that could make it even better is an evening with my special girl.\n\nOh, and who's that?\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nOh, I just didn't know if you meant me or Alex.\n\nUm, why would I mean Alex?\n\nBecause I know she hit on you and I know you liked it!\n\nWhat...?\n\nDon't play dumb with me,\n\nRicardo Shilly-Shally!\n\nI'm missing something.\n\nDid you say something to Penny about Alex?\n\nOh, yes. Yeah, and a fat lot of good it did me.\n\nAll she did was get mad at you.\n\nWhy would you do that?\n\nI needed advice about a woman.\n\nI would have asked you, but if the last few years have proven anything, it's that you can't tell a uterus from a unicycle.\n\nAt least I know not to blab to a girl about somebody flirting with her boyfriend.\n\nGood to know.\n\nYeah, a few more helpful hints like that, you may find yourself on the Council of Ladies.\n\nHello.\n\nI see.\n\nUh, what time?\n\nVery well, then.\n\nHuh.\n\nThat was the Human Resources\n\nDepartment at the university.\n\nApparently, my assistant Alex has filed a complaint accusing me of inappropriate behavior in the workplace.\n\nOh, my God, what did you do?\n\nHmm, let me think.\n\nNothing. I'm a delight.\n\nHuman Resources Department.\n\nHuman Resources Department.\n\nHuman Resources\n\nDepartment.\n\nCome in.\n\nHello.\n\nAh, Dr. Cooper, have a seat.\n\nThank you.\n\nI called you in today because your assistant\n\nAlex Jensen has lodged a complaint against you.\n\nSo I've been told.\n\nBut I can't understand what she has to complain about.\n\nI mean, she has a front-row seat as I make scientific history.\n\nThere's string cheese in my mini-fridge, and that's for anyone.\n\nYeah, and just yesterday\n\nI led her away from a life of sexual promiscuity by making her look at pictures of disease-ridden genitalia.\n\nCancel my next appointment.\n\nThis is gonna take a while.\n\nDr. Cooper, you said things to your employee that you just cannot say in the workplace.\n\nLike what?\n\nWell, according to Ms. Jensen, you said that she was a slave to her biological urges and called her an \"egg salad sandwich.\"\n\nI don't even know what that means, but I'm gonna go ahead and tell you you can't say it.\n\nOh! I see the confusion here.\n\nNo, no, Alex thought\n\nI was singling her out. No.\n\nI meant that all women are slaves to their biological urges, you know?\n\nEven you.\n\nYou're a slave.\n\nI'm a what?\n\nWell, y-you...\n\nI-I'm just saying, you know, at a certain point in a woman's menstrual cycle...\n\nWhuh-ah!\n\nYou can't talk about that, either, Dr. Cooper.\n\nYour language is entirely inappropriate, and I'm gonna advise that you shut your mouth right now.\n\nI d... I don't see why I'm the one being persecuted here.\n\nDr. Hofstadter-- he was bragging about his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen.\n\nYou know, and\n\nHoward Wolowitz-- he spent two years using university resources building a six-breasted sex robot.\n\nOh, and at the office\n\nChristmas party,\n\nI heard Rajesh Koothrappali refer to you several times as \"Brown Sugar.\"\n\nHofstadter...\n\nWolowitz... and the last one was\n\nRajesh Koothrappali?\n\nYes.\n\nNo, yeah, but in his defense, that wasn't racist.\n\nHe's also brown. \u266a I'm... sorry Alex hit on me \u266a \u266a Hit on me \u266a Hit on me... \u266a Sorry Alex \u266a Hit on me,\n\nI'd no idea I'm cute. \u266a\n\nOh, damn it, you are.\n\nPlease forgive me.\n\nI should have told you about Alex.\n\nI don't care about Alex.\n\nFine, I care.\n\nOkay, I hate that bitch.\n\nBut what really hurt is that you liked it so much.\n\nI mean, do I need to be worried?\n\nOf course not. No. Why?\n\nBecause... she is pretty and smart, and when you talk about work, she doesn't have to go home and look up words in the dictionary to understand what you said.\n\nYou do that?\n\nNo.\n\nHang on.\n\nAre you feeling insecure?\n\nBecause that's my thing, and if you take it away, I don't know what I'm bringing to this relationship.\n\nYes, Leonard, I am insecure.\n\nHappy?\n\nNo,\n\nI'm not happy.\n\nWhy are you smiling?\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nI just never think of you having feelings like that.\n\nWell, I do.\n\nWhy?\n\nNothing is ever going to happen between me and Alex.\n\nGood.\n\nCome here.\n\nI'll tell you a secret?\n\nWhat's that?\n\nWith all these women chasing me,\n\nI kind of do feel like Captain Kirk.\n\nCan I tell you a secret?\n\nSure.\n\nKeep talking about Captain Kirk, and we're all gonna stop.\n\nMessage... received.\n\nAh, excuse me.\n\nHello.\n\nThis is Dr. Hofstadter.\n\nOkay.\n\nAll right, thank you.\n\nThat's weird.\n\nI'm getting called in to Human Resources.\n\nWhat did you do?\n\nI don't know.\n\nHuh. I just got called in to Human Resources.\n\nWhy?\n\nI don't know.\n\nHuh. That is so strange.\n\nHuman Resources wants to talk to me tomorrow.\n\nCould you stop licking your ass for two minutes?\n\nI have a problem here.\n\nDo you really think you should be drinking right now?\n\nHow else am I supposed to talk to the Human Resources lady?\n\nI don't know.\n\nSeek professional help?\n\nI did. The guy at the liquor store said this stuff tastes great in coffee.\n\nWait, you got called in, too?\n\nWhat is going on?\n\nSheldon threw us all under the bus.\n\nOh.\n\nI feel like I've been called down to the principal's office.\n\nAlthough I wouldn't mind if Brown Sugar suspended me.\n\nFrom a sex swing!\n\nThis may have been a mistake.\n\nRelax. Everything's gonna be fine.\n\nYou know, before\n\nI met Bernadette\n\nI was in here every other day.\n\nUh, little tip: turn off your \"I Like Big Butts\" ringtone before you go in.\n\nWell, this is all your fault.\n\nHow is this my fault?\n\nIf you weren't screwing around with Sheldon's assistant, none of this would be happening.\n\nI wasn't screwing around with anyone.\n\nOh, of course not.\n\nShe was just sniffing around your goods because she was hunting for truffles.\n\nAh, Mr. Wolowitz, it's been a while.\n\nHey, Janine.\n\nHow are Tom and the kids?\n\nFine.\n\nYou must be\n\nDr. Hofstadter.\n\nYes, but I think this is all a big misunderstanding.\n\nYeah, yeah, me, too.\n\nI didn't do anything.\n\nIs that alcohol on your breath?\n\nHoward built a sex robot.\n\nThat is not true.\n\nAll I did was build a robot.\n\nDid it have six breasts?\n\nI'm sorry,\n\nI'm a feminist--\n\nI don't notice things like how many breasts a robot has.\n\nWell, hello.\n\nWhat are you doing here?\n\nActually, I came to speak to Mrs. Davis.\n\nAnd I'm a little busy right now.\n\nBut I came to file a complaint.\n\nYeah, somebody has made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace by using language of an inappropriate and sexual nature.\n\nAnd who was that?\n\nYou, you dirty birdie.\n\nI-I thought about the things you said to me yesterday, and I realized\n\nI'm deeply offended.\n\nNow, be a dear and get me one of those complaint forms.\n\nThat's it.\n\nAll of you, in my office now!\n\nAnd thanks to you, I know better than to ask if you're menstruating.\n\nAnd based on your behavior,\n\nI don't have to.\n\nIt has been pointed out to me that... some of the things I said to you could be construed as... offensive, and I would like to offer you my sincerest apology.\n\nThank you, Dr. Cooper.\n\nYeah, additionally, you should know that the university has mandated that I take an online sexual harassment seminar so this sort of thing doesn't happen in the future.\n\nOkay.\n\nYeah. Now, unfortunately, uh, my time is much too valuable to waste on nonsense like this, so... um, I'm gonna need you to take it for me.\n\nOh, and, uh, you'd better ace it-- they're pretty mad.\n\nSo, hey, I was thinking about that stuff with Alex.\n\nOh, would you stop worrying about that?\n\nI can't help it.\n\nBut, look, I figured\n\nI could sit around and feel insecure, or I could do something about it.\n\nSo I got a course catalog at school and looked at some of the science classes.\n\nThat's great.\n\nNo, it isn't-- they are extremely boring.\n\nI mean, how do you not kill yourself, like, every day?\n\nAnyway, I decided\n\nI don't need to be a scientist,\n\nI could just look like one.\n\nSo I bought these.\n\nGlasses?\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nI really don't think that's gonna change-- oh, my God, you look so smart and hot!\n\nI know, right?\n\nWatch this.\n\nMolecules.\n\nOkay, come with me.\n\nWhere are we going?\n\nTo my bedroom, so I can take everything off but those glasses... and maybe the boots. == sync, corrected by elderman ==\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "3f73aa13-eabd-4d2b-8a39-65a08a3bfd3f": {"__data__": {"id_": "3f73aa13-eabd-4d2b-8a39-65a08a3bfd3f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "8958664181235db764b85daf599256c9dfa03fbe71c1ea52d0c1658936b6f46a", "text": "  \ufeff1\n\nHey, will you steam my uniform next?\n\nYeah, w...\n\nInteresting.\n\nDo you recall this conversation? \"Leonard, want to go halfsies on a steamer?\" \"No, Sheldon, we don't need a steamer.\"\n\nLooks like that rumpled chicken's come home to roost.\n\nHi.\n\nHere are the make-up sponges you asked for.\n\nOh, thanks,\n\nI thought I had more.\n\nDamn, you've got more makeup than I do.\n\nYou've got better makeup than I do.\n\nYeah, I'm borrowing this.\n\nHey, hey, hey, hey.\n\nThis is my Comic-Con makeup.\n\nI love you, but there are some things a man doesn't share with his girlfriend.\n\nThat's a wise policy.\n\nI once borrowed my sister's makeup for a costume contest.\n\nGot a terrible case of pinkeye.\n\nYeah, but luckily,\n\nI was going as a zombie.\n\nI won second place.\n\nI feel like you guys just went to Comic-Con.\n\nThat was San Diego Comic-Con.\n\nThis is Bakersfield Comic-Con.\n\nIs that better?\n\nWell, it's a lot smaller.\n\nIt's more about the comic books.\n\nThe way these conventions used to be before they went all Hollywood.\n\nSo to answer your question, no, it's not better.\n\nWell, then why are you going?\n\nIt's a comic book convention.\n\nYou know, it's like pizza or particle accelerators, even the stinky one's still pretty good.\n\nAll right.\n\nWell, you guys have fun.\n\nI guess I'll see you\n\nSunday night.\n\nYeah.\n\nOkay.\n\nOh, hang on a second.\n\nHold this.\n\nWhat was that for?\n\nTo show people when they don't believe me. \u266a Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \u266a \u266a Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started...

Then how does the sun come \"up\" every day?\n\nHard to argue with those kind of street smarts.\n\nLeonard and Sheldon have boxes of comics across the hall.\n\nWhy don't we go look at those?\n\nOh, great! Yes!\n\nAnd then you will see.\n\nI am not wrong, because if we were in outer space, then anyone could pick up the hammer because it would be floating around in a weightless environment.\n\nYeah, that's right, the slow reader used science.\n\nSuck on that.\n\nWas there anything valuable in the car?\n\nOur clothes, our wallets, phones.\n\nAnd about $300 worth of makeup, so this thief could look like anyone right now.\n\nMakeup?\n\nSure.\n\nUh, we're going to the Comic-Con in Bakersfield.\n\nThey have a big costume contest.\n\nIt's cooler than it sounds.\n\nI don't know, sounds pretty cool.\n\nI-It is.\n\nIt's not just comic books.\n\nThey've got action figures, toys, a Tron-themed dance party...\n\nOkay, he gets how cool it is.\n\nI think I have all I need here.\n\nYou guys need me to call someone?\n\nI'm guessing your moms?\n\nThanks, but we've got it covered.\n\nOkay,\n\nI just talked to my mom.\n\nShe arranged for us to get a rental car.\n\nGreat.\n\nWe can still make it to Comic-Con.\n\nAre you kidding me?\n\nAfter all we've been through,\n\nI just want to go home.\n\nDon't be like that.\n\nCome on, Howard, talk to him.\n\nI'm with Leonard.\n\nI'm done.\n\nFine, then I guess it's two against two.\n\nHow do we decide?\n\nActually, it's three against one.\n\nWhat?!\n\nWhat about the mission?\n\nYou said we were a real-life landing party.\n\nYeah, well, we're not.\n\nWe're an imaginary landing party who had real-life garbage thrown at us by real-life strangers who think we're idiots.\n\nAnd to tell you the truth,\n\nI'm starting to feel like one.\n\nI want to go home now.\n\nOkay.\n\nDid we at least rent the car from Enterprise?\n\nGet it? Enterprise?\n\nScrew you. That's funny.\n\nWell, what if the\n\nHulk picked up Thor while Thor is holding the hammer?\n\nYeah?\n\nThen by the transitive property of picking things up,\n\nHulk picked up the hammer.\n\nNo.\n\nHulk picked up Thor,\n\nThor picked up the hammer.\n\nOkay, hang on.\n\nIf I go to a bar and pick up a guy, and he picks up a girl, and then we all leave together, did I pick up the girl?\n\nDid that ever happen?\n\nHey, are we talking about me or are we talking about Thor?\n\nWell, I say that's the last time we ever go outside.\n\nLook, right here.\n\nRed Hulk is picking up Thor's hammer 'cause Thor's touching it.\n\nNo, it's because they're in space.\n\nHe's really just touching the strap.\n\nThe strap is part of the hammer!\n\nNo, it's not!\n\nAre they actually arguing about comic books?\n\nNo, that can't be right.\n\nMaybe \"Thor's Hammer\" is a new color of nail polish.\n\nThen Red Hulk must be worthy.\n\nHow could\n\nRed Hulk be worthy?\n\nYou don't know his life!\n\nThere's only one logical explanation.\n\nSomewhere in the desert we crossed into an alternate dimension... where the women in our lives can finally appreciate great literature.\n\nIf it's an alternate dimension... sounds like a job for a landing party.\n\nCaptain, what are your orders?\n\nI say we investigate.\n\nWait.\n\nThey might be hostile.\n\nFine, but set them to stun.\n\nIf we vaporize Penny,\n\nI'll never find a girlfriend that pretty again.\n\nPresident Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act from his hospital room.\n\nWow, that is interesting.\n\nYou learn something new every day.\n\nSay, can you name the four state capitols that are not served by the interstate system?\n\nOoh, another quiz.\n\nYes! == sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "9d200c5e-3ce0-42f4-a966-1d1f168b7fa9": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d200c5e-3ce0-42f4-a966-1d1f168b7fa9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "16c309f7a819cbda5bede34760aa2108931045ddb3c2632359b727e70ca4af3f", "text": "\n\nSheldon, your food's getting cold.\n\nI'll eat later.\n\nRight now, I'm suckling at the informative bosom of mother physics.\n\nIt's hot when\n\nSheldon talks dirty.\n\nSo, I found this Web site where you send them pictures, they sculpt your head and make an action figure out of you.\n\nHow awesome is that?\n\nOh, let me see.\n\nYeah, you can pick your wardrobe.\n\nYou can even choose your accessories.\n\nLeonard, you can get a little asthma inhaler.\n\nOh, this is neat.\n\nThink about all the action figures we've bought over the years.\n\nIt would be kind of cool to have ones that look like us.\n\nDon't you think?\n\nYeah, if that's your idea of what's cool, you should get one.\n\nYeah, so, I'm out.\n\nWhat do you think,\n\nSheldon?\n\nWant an action figure that looks just like you?\n\nWould it come with kung-fu grip?\n\nNo.\n\nDon't waste my time.\n\nYou get that these are personalize action figures.\n\nHoney, if you want one, just get one.\n\nYou're still out, right?\n\nYep. \u266a Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \u266a \u266a Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started...

words.\n\nNo, hang on.\n\nOkay, one word, a letter and a number and... maybe a hyphen.\n\nI have always wanted a 3-D printer.\n\nOf course you have.\n\nThey're an engineer's dream.\n\nAnything you can design, a 3-D printer can make out of plastic.\n\nYeah, but they're so expensive.\n\nOh, come on.\n\nYou deserve one.\n\nYou've worked hard to find a woman who makes a lot of money.\n\nWell, the prices have been coming down.\n\nOh, true.\n\nThey're practically giving them away.\n\nYou know, in exchange for money.\n\nAnd we can make stuff we need for work with it.\n\nPrototypes of my CAD/CAM designs, specialized tools...\n\nNot to mention\n\nMalibu Koothrappali and his totally bitchin' dream house.\n\nWe don't need Malibu\n\nKoothrappali's dream house.\n\nReally, smart guy?\n\nWhere's he supposed to park his sweet little Corvette?\n\nThe monkey in my tobacco study has taken to smoking a pipe.\n\nI'm supposed to remove his brain to examine, but it's hard because now he reminds me of my uncle.\n\nYou've been awfully quiet tonight.\n\nIs everything okay?\n\nI'm fine.\n\nAll right, well, how was work today?\n\nDid you exchange your research with Kripke?\n\nYes.\n\nSheldon, what's going on?\n\nI read his research, and... it's leaps and bounds ahead of mine.\n\nWhich means the mommy of the smartest physicist at the university is not my mommy as I had thought.\n\nIt's his mommy.\n\nSheldon, I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better.\n\nMay I offer you a consoling hug?\n\nWhat do we have to lose?\n\nHow's that?\n\nI feel like I'm being strangled by a boa constrictor.\n\nWhy'd you stop?\n\nCome on, Sheldon!\n\nWe're going to be late!\n\nI can't go in today.\n\nI'm sick.\n\nYou're not sick.\n\nYou just don't want to face Kripke.\n\nNo, look.\n\nSee?\n\nWhat did you do, put this in your tea?\n\nOh, dear.\n\nNow I'm not even smarter than you.\n\nSheldon, Kripke's not smarter than you.\n\nYou just got stuck on a wrong path.\n\nHappened to Einstein.\n\nHe got stuck on the unified field theory for decades.\n\nOh, don't play the Einstein card.\n\nHis great breakthroughs happened when no one knew anything.\n\nSo everything was a great breakthrough.\n\nSheldon Lee Cooper,\n\nI do not have time for this nonsense.\n\nNow, go put your clothes on, get in the car, and lets go to work.\n\nAll right, geez.\n\nWhat a grouch.\n\nHow did I do that?\n\nI got to remember how I did that.\n\nDo you realize, by owning a 3-D printer, we are reclaiming the manufacturing process and taking jobs back from sweatshops in China?\n\nI think this thing was made in China.\n\nEh, what can you do?\n\nOoh, I-I think it's done.\n\nIt worked!\n\nWe printed a whistle.\n\nAmazing.\n\nYou realize these things go for 25 cents a pop at a party store.\n\nAnd we made it in only three hours.\n\nSounds just like store-bought.\n\nOkay, give me a superhero pose, and I will scan you into the computer for your action figure.\n\nOh, I wish I was in better shape.\n\nStop holding your stomach in.\n\nI'll give you a six-pack with the computer.\n\nOh, okay, great.\n\nNow I can look like Val Kilmer as Batman instead of Val Kilmer as he looks today.\n\nAll right, you can suck it in a little bit.\n\nCooper, we have a problem.\n\nYour work is really not at a level\n\nI expected it to be.\n\nI know.\n\nGo ahead, mock me.\n\nJust use small words so I understand.\n\nDon't play dumb with me.\n\nWe both know what your problem is.\n\nWe do?\n\nYou have a girlfriend.\n\nSo?\n\nSo my work would suffer, too, if I was getting laid all the time.\n\nYes.\n\nThat is the reason.\n\nMy work is suffering because of... all the laid I'm getting.\n\nYou lucky bastard.\n\nWhat can I say, you know?\n\nShe enjoys my genitals.\n\nI am giving them to her on a nightly basis.\n\nOkay, stop bragging.\n\nYou had some brilliant insights in here, but if we're gonna make this work, you need to buckle down and focus.\n\nI'll do what I can.\n\nBut it's not going to be easy, because when I'm with Amy and our bathing suit areas mush together... boy howdy, is it magic\n\nOh, good, you're home.\n\nGot a little surprise for you.\n\nWhat?\n\nSay hello to my little friend.\n\nOh, my God.\n\nThat's so cute.\n\nI didn't think there could be a smaller version of you.\n\nI know, right?\n\nAnd, thanks to photographs and a little here comes the bride.\n\nOh, Howie,\n\nI love these.\n\nI thought you might.\n\nWere they expensive?\n\nDidn't cost a thing.\n\nI made them myself.\n\nHow?\n\nKoothrappali and I bought a used 3-D printer for $5,000. $5,000 for a couple of dolls?\n\nAre you out of your mind?\n\nNot just a couple of dolls.\n\nFor as many dolls as we want.\n\nAnd whistles.\n\nAt any point, did it dawn on you to talk to me about spending this kind of money?\n\nIt's kind of dawning on me now.\n\nI don't believe you!\n\nHowie, we can't afford to waste money on junk like this.\n\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nWe make plenty of money.\n\nYou make peanuts!\n\nYes, but we're married now.\n\nThat means, when you get sick,\n\nI take care of you.\n\nAnd when you make a bunch of money,\n\nI get to buy stuff.\n\nSorry if you don't like it, but that's how love works.\n\nNo, here's how love works.\n\nYou're gonna return the machine, or you can print out a working set of lady parts and sleep with those.\n\nOh, my God! Are you actually thinking about it?\n\nAll right, I don't understand.\n\nWhy didn't you just tell Kripke the truth?\n\nBecause the truth made me look bad, whereas a ridiculous bald-faced lie makes me look good.\n\nAnyway, if Kripke asks, tell him my coitus with Amy is frequent, intense and whimsically inventive.\n\nIs my coitus whimsically inventive?\n\nThat is what I write on the bathroom walls. \"For a whimsically inventive time, call Leonard Hofstadter.\"\n\nI know you're joking, but I'd be okay with that.\n\nYeah.\n\nSheldon, can I ask you a question?\n\nOf course.\n\nYou ever going to sleep with Amy?\n\nThat's awfully personal.\n\nWe don't ask Sheldon things like that.\n\nMaybe you don't; I do.\n\nWhat's the deal?\n\nWell, word around the university is I'm giving her sex organs a proper jostling.\n\nAll right, come on, be serious.\n\nLook, you guys have been going out a long time.\n\nShe would clearly like to have a physical relationship with you, so what are you doing?\n\nAll right, we're down the rabbit hole.\n\nWhat <i>are</i> you doing?\n\nWell, first of all,\n\nI'm quite fond of Amy.\n\nThen what's the problem?\n\nPenny... all my life,\n\nI have been uncomfortable with the sort of physical contact that comes easily to others-- hand-shaking, hugging, prostate exams.\n\nBut I'm working on it, you know?\n\nJust recently, I had to put\n\nVapoRub on Amy's chest.\n\nA year ago, that would have been unthinkable.\n\nNow you know how I feel when I have to put it on you.\n\nOkay. Hang on.\n\nAre you saying someday you and Amy might... actually get physical?\n\nIt's a possibility.\n\nOh, my God!\n\nSheldon, I know this wasn't easy for you, and I'm really glad we could have this conversation.\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nOw!\n\nAre you sure you want to do this?\n\nGive up your half of the 3-D printer?\n\nYes.\n\nAnd can you please make that out to Bernadette?\n\nI was taken off the joint account until I learn the value of money.\n\nWow, that's harsh.\n\nTell me about it.\n\nAren't you gonna eat lunch?\n\nNah, I blew my food allowance on Pokemon cards.\n\nWell, the equation balances, but it's certainly not elegant.\n\nWhatever.\n\nYou get any last night?\n\nYes.\n\nGave it to her good, huh?\n\nNo, I gave it to her well.\n\nNow, over here,\n\nI was thinking the turbulence could be reduced if we just put...\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nWas she naked, or was she wearing lingerie?\n\nI didn't notice.\n\nHow could you not notice?\n\nI was too busy squishing all the desirable parts of her body.\n\nAh, you're killing me, Cooper!\n\nCan we get back to work?\n\nSure, sure, sure.\n\nYou guys ever use any toys?\n\nToys?\n\nI do have a model rocket next to my bed.\n\nA rocket?\n\nYou're a freak!

You can't.\n\nI'm gonna go see if Leonard's room is big enough for my water bed.\n\nUm...\n\nGood buddy Leonard.\n\nGood buddy Leonard.\n\nGood buddy Leonard.\n\nWhat do you want?\n\nHey, good buddy.\n\nSo, uh, I was just talking to Amy, and she made me realize that this little dust-up between you and me is much ado about nothing.\n\nIs that so?\n\nYes.\n\nAll is forgiven, so come back home.\n\nI'll make you some soy hot chocolate, and then I'll you tell you about our exciting new devil-may-care bathroom policy.\n\nCut to the chase, Sheldon.\n\nOkay. Amy's decided she wants to move in with me, so I need you to come back home, you lovable scamp.\n\nThat's a lot of product.\n\nHey.\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nOh, get this:\n\nSuddenly, Sheldon wants me back because Amy wants to move in with him.\n\nReally? Interesting.\n\nWell, too late, pal.\n\nI'm not going anywhere.\n\nPenny and I are very happy living together.\n\nIsn't that right?\n\nIt's like the happiness won't ever leave the apartment.\n\nLeonard, please.\n\nYou know Amy moving in marks a level of intimacy our relationship isn't ready for.\n\nYes! That is a real thing.\n\nAnd it doesn't mean you don't care about each other; it just means things are moving at a pace you're not comfortable with, and that's fine.\n\nWell, if he doesn't want to live with her, then he should tell her how he feels.\n\nWell, maybe he doesn't know how to say it without hurting her feelings.\n\nFeelings?\n\nWhat am I, a hippie at a love-in? No.\n\nThe problem is, she laid out a series of logical arguments that I couldn't refute.\n\nThat is the worst, isn't it?\n\nYes.\n\nI'm sorry, Sheldon.\n\nI can't help you.\n\nOh, spoiler alert:\n\nThis door's about to slam in your face.\n\nOh, there you are.\n\nWhen do I get a key to our apartment?\n\nUm...\n\nHello?\n\nHey. How'd it go last night with my mom?\n\nOkay, I guess.\n\nWhat time did you leave?\n\nActually, I'm still here.\n\nWhat? You spent the night?\n\nYeah. Uh... after dinner, we watched a rerun of <i>Rockford Files,</i> and then she opened a bottle of, uh, cream sherry, and the next thing I know, she was tucking me into your bed.\n\nYou wore my pajamas?\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nHow do you sleep in these things?\n\nSilk pajamas on satin sheets?\n\nI slid out of the bed, like, three times.\n\nRajesh!\n\nYou up?\n\nYou ready for breakfast?\n\nOh, boy. Breakfast.\n\nOkay, Raj, listen to me.\n\nYou need to get out of there.\n\nBut I have a cream sherry hangover and I smell blintzes.\n\nIf you don't leave now, she'll use food and guilt to keep you there for the rest of your life.\n\nOh, Howard, stop.\n\nTrust me, you're not Jewish.\n\nThat's how they get you.\n\nYou're being silly.\n\nI can leave whenever I want.\n\nOh, really? Where are your clothes and your shoes?\n\nThey're on the chair, right over...\n\nOy vey.\n\nHello, home wrecker.\n\nWhat did I do?\n\nYou gave Leonard somewhere to go.\n\nThanks to you, Amy's out buying his and hers bath towels.\n\nLike I'd ever dry myself with something that has a possessive pronoun on it.\n\nOkay.\n\nListen, the truth is\n\nI don't want him living with me.\n\nGreat. Kick him out.\n\nBreak his heart.\n\nEverybody wins.\n\nNo, I don't want to break his heart.\n\nI love him.\n\nThis is just happening too fast.\n\nYou think this is fast?\n\nIt's just a matter of time before I see Amy's leg stubble in my shower.\n\nYeah, and I've seen those legs.\n\nYou might want to get some Drano.\n\nHold on.\n\nIf you don't want to live with Leonard, why don't you just tell him?\n\nWell, you know how he is.\n\nHe's sensitive and emotional.\n\nThat's because he drinks too much soy milk.\n\nWell, I don't know what else we can do but tell them the truth.\n\nI suppose there's no choice but to face the crying, angry accusations and the high-pitched wails of despair.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd who knows how Amy will react.\n\nHere's some more ice.\n\nOh, thanks.\n\nWhat were we thinking?\n\nWe should have just done it the regular way.\n\nThose Chinese acrobats in Cirque du Soleil made it look so easy.\n\nHonestly, if I could bend that far, what would I need with you?\n\nIf you could bend that far, you'd be doing us both a favor.\n\nHey, Raj. What's up?\n\nYou were right!\n\nI can't get out of here!\n\nYou're still at my mother's?\n\nI'm trapped.\n\nMy clothes have been in the laundry all day, and she hid my keys.\n\nI think they might be in her bra, because she jingles when she walks.\n\nWhat do I do?\n\nHey, you wanted a woman in your life.\n\nNow you got one.\n\nCome on, Howard, help me.\n\nRajesh, <i>tatellah,</i>\n\nI ran you a bath.\n\nOh, my God.\n\nShe's not gonna bathe me, is she?\n\nGee, I wish I could tell you no.\n\nAll right, well, thanks again for helping me out.\n\nBut, Howard...\n\nShould we go back and rescue him?\n\nIt's too late.\n\nWe'll see him at his Bar Mitzvah.\n\nHere you go.\n\nI picked up the Chinese food just the way Leonard used to.\n\nIs it kung pao chicken?\n\nYes.\n\nBrown rice, not white rice?\n\nYes.\n\nSpicy mustard from the Korean deli?\n\nYes. I did good, right?\n\nYes.\n\nAmy, are you worried that us living together will take the mystery out of our relationship?\n\nNo.\n\nYeah, why would you?\n\nOh, and, uh, check this out.\n\nI took the liberty of scripting a new outgoing voice mail message for both of us. \"Hello. This is Sheldon.\" \"And this is Amy.\" \"We're not home right now.\" \"'Cause we out dropping science, son.\" \"Leave a message.\"\n\nBeep.\n\nYou can't live here.\n\nWhat?\n\nWhy?\n\nIs it the message?\n\nI only used urban slang to sound tough so people wouldn't break in.\n\nNo.\n\nIt's not the message.\n\nWell, what is it, then?\n\nI did everything just the way you like it.\n\nYou did.\n\nThen what the hell, Sheldon?!\n\nWe have been going out for over two years, and I have been nothing but patient with you!\n\nI watch your dopey space movies.\n\nI signed your ridiculous contract.\n\nI even stopped wearing lip gloss 'cause you said it made my mouth look too slippery.\n\nI am the best girlfriend you're ever gonna have.\n\nYou give me one good reason why I can't live here.\n\nIt's Penny's fault.\n\nWhat?\n\nShe doesn't want to live with Leonard, so he has to come live here again.\n\nShe's the snake in our garden.\n\nShe's the reason we can't be happy.\n\nHey, Ames.\n\nYeah. \"Hey, Ames,\" nothing.\n\nI was all set to move in with Sheldon, and now I hear\n\nI can't 'cause you don't want to live with Leonard.\n\nWhat?\n\nSheldon, what did you say?\n\nI said the truth.\n\nYou don't want to live with\n\nLeonard, and you know it.\n\nSince when don't you want to live with me?\n\nOh, don't get all huffy.\n\nYou're the one who decided to move in without even asking me if I was ready.\n\nYeah, I think we should talk about that.\n\nAnd since you love the truth so much, why don't you tell Amy you don't want to live with her instead of blaming it on me?\n\nI thought we were talking about the other thing.\n\nYou're a coward.\n\nWell, the evidence does support that.\n\nCome on, Amy, let's go drink wine and talk about what jerks our boyfriends are.\n\nYou know what would show them?\n\nI should move in here with you.\n\nUm...\n\nDo you want to... catch up on some <i>Walking Dead?</i>\n\nOkay.\n\nHave you seen the one where Lori dies?\n\nNo.\n\nOr maybe she doesn't.\n\nLet's find out.\n\nWhere you going?\n\nNo! == sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "5e7063c4-8148-4181-8a08-566aa6d0ce97": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e7063c4-8148-4181-8a08-566aa6d0ce97", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "9433fd212307eb3d5e3294b29179f7fa67ca17b2ca0cf91ec448b2e5bd59d9ba", "text": "\n\nYou'll never believe what happened to me at work today.\n\nHmm?\n\nThis old guy was choking on his food, and I saved his life.\n\nYou're kidding.\n\nDid you Heimlich him?\n\nNo. I said, \"Oh, my God,\n\nI think that old guy's choking,\" and then one of the busboys\n\nHeimlich'ed him.\n\nYou're a hero.\n\nYeah, that was the point of the story.\n\nOh, yeah, speaking of work, do you know if you have\n\nThursday night off?\n\nUm, I think so.

Nothing.\n\nNo, tell me.\n\nIt's just this guy\n\nI used to date.\n\nOh.\n\nUntil he cheated on me with my friend Gretchen, who's here with him now.\n\nYou're kidding.\n\nAnd it looks like she lost a lot of weight, damn it.\n\nI know it's not ideal, but don't let them ruin our night.\n\nNo, you're totally right.\n\nShe could be skinny 'cause she's dying.\n\nThat's the spirit.\n\nYou know what, screw them.\n\nOur night is going to be way more special than theirs.\n\nYeah.\n\nUh-oh.\n\nWhat?\n\nOh, you got to be kidding me.\n\nOh, my God, yes.\n\nOf course\n\nI'll marry you.\n\nTwo can play this game.\n\nPenny...\n\nGet up.\n\nAll right.\n\nIt's nice that all the people who are lonely on Valentine's Day can come here tonight and be together.\n\nYeah, I'm really looking forward to it.\n\nIn fact, there's no place\n\nI would rather be than here.\n\nExcept on a date with anybody.\n\nLiterally anybody.\n\nYou know, you and I have so much fun hanging out.\n\nIf you were a girl, all our problems would be solved.\n\nWhat?\n\nOh, yeah, think about it.\n\nWe'd hang out, we'd read comic books, we'd see movies.\n\nIt'd be like the best relationship ever.\n\nThat does sound nice.\n\nThen I'd take you home, slip off your little black dress and just pile-drive you into oblivion.\n\nWhat?\n\nOh, I can't believe he's going to marry the girl he cheated on me with.\n\nIsn't it kind of nice?\n\nI mean, he was with the wrong person, and now he found the right person.\n\nWhat, so I'm the wrong person?\n\nMaybe you want to be with Gretchen, too.\n\nThey do look happy.\n\nYeah, maybe tonight.\n\nBut a year from now, he'll be crawling under the sink looking for his Xbox.\n\nWell, he will.\n\nYou know what? Why don't we just forget about them and enjoy our Valentine's Day?\n\nYes, absolutely.\n\nNow they're doing that phony link-arm-drink thingy.\n\nI totally taught him that.\n\nI thought we were letting it go.\n\nWe were; it's just... it's not fair, okay?\n\nThey're bad people.\n\nIt's not supposed to end happy for them; it's supposed to end happy for me.\n\nUm... it did end happy for you.\n\nYou're here with me.\n\nYeah, yeah, I know.\n\nOkay, this is getting a little hard to not take personally.\n\nOh, come on, don't make this about you.\n\nOh, I'm not.\n\nIt's about you.\n\nYeah, well, whatever, okay?\n\nI told you,\n\nValentine's Day sucks.\n\nThis one does, and you're the reason why.\n\nWhat?\n\nYou know, compared to them,\n\nI'm feeling pretty good about us.\n\nMe, too.\n\nHow about we blow off dessert, go home early...\n\nI'll do that laundry.\n\nThank you.\n\nI love you.\n\nLove you, too.\n\nSo where'd you hide it?\n\nWhere you'd never look.\n\nDamn it, it's in the washing machine.\n\nHello.\n\nHello.\n\nHappy Valentine's Day.\n\nOkay.\n\nShall we go to dinner?\n\nHang on.\n\nAs you know, I had planned a traditional evening of romance and gifts.\n\nYes, and as you know,\n\nI planned to pretend to enjoy it.\n\nI've been working on this facial expression all day.\n\nAnd I appreciate your effort, but upon contemplation,\n\nI decided I was being selfish.\n\nSo, I canceled our dinner reservations and came up with an even better way to celebrate Valentine's Day.\n\nWhat is that?\n\nBy doing none of it-- no dinner, no romance, no gifts.\n\nWe stay here, order a pizza and watch one of your beloved\n\nStar War Trek things.\n\nReally?\n\nWell, that's what you'd love, isn't it?\n\nMore than anything.\n\nWell, then... that's what we're going to do.\n\nWell...\n\nI don't know what to say.\n\nThis is the most thoughtful gift that anyone's ever given me.\n\nAnd that's including an amazing gift that I gave myself earlier today.\n\nI'm your girlfriend.\n\nThat's my job.\n\nAnd I know gift-giving puts a lot of pressure on you, so whatever you got me, you can return.\n\nNo.\n\nNo, after everything you didn't do for me tonight,\n\nI want you to have it.\n\nWhat's this?\n\nRead it. \"Sheldon Cooper,\n\nCaltech University employee information\"?\n\nAt the bottom. \"In case of emergency, please contact...\n\nAmy Farrah Fowler.\"\n\nAnd there's my phone number.\n\nThis is the most beautiful gift you could've ever given me.\n\nWell, I thought, if I have a stroke or a kidney stone, who would I want to share that with?\n\nAnd you picked me.\n\nIt's like you said-- you're my girlfriend.\n\nOh, Sheldon.\n\nYeah...\n\nOkay.\n\nStop ruining Valentine's Day and order my pizza.\n\nNight.\n\nYep.\n\nYou know what?\n\nThat was pretty crappy of you.\n\nI mean, all I wanted to do was give you a great night, and it's like you-you went out of your way to destroy it.\n\nYeah, I know.\n\nI'm a total bitch.\n\nI'm not saying that.\n\nWell, I am.\n\nFine, you win.\n\nYou're a bitch.\n\nWhy couldn't we just have a nice time?\n\nI don't know.\n\nMaybe 'cause things are going so well between us lately and I've been really happy.\n\nOkay, you're gonna have to make a lot more sense than that.\n\nObviously, I have some commitment issues.\n\nGlaringly obvious.\n\nGo on.\n\nAs long as things keep going great between us, you'll keep asking me to marry you, and eventually I'm gonna end up saying yes, and then we're gonna be married forever, and the whole thing just freaks me out.\n\nOkay.\n\nI know I propose a lot.\n\nSo how about this?\n\nI promise I will never ask you to marry me again.\n\nWhat... what do you mean?\n\nAre you breaking up with me?\n\nNo.\n\nNo, no, no, no.\n\nBut if someday you decide you want to get married, you have to propose to me.\n\nReally?\n\nYes.\n\nIt's all on you.\n\nBut I got to tell you, when the time comes,\n\nI want the whole nine yards.\n\nI want you down on one knee, flowers.\n\nI want to be swept off my feet.\n\nYeah, you got it.\n\nAnd I'm cool with surprises.\n\nBut nothing on a Jumbotron.\n\nI don't want to cry on a big screen like that.\n\nOkay.\n\nYou know what?\n\nThis might be the wine talking, but I have a very important question to ask you.\n\nYou do?\n\nLeonard Hofstadter...\n\nYes? ...will you be my valentine?\n\nSorry. Maybe next year.\n\nI'm just kidding!\n\nRomance ninja.\n\nLet's have sex! Wah!\n\nThank you, guys, for doing this.\n\nWe're glad you could make it.\n\nUsually I spend Valentine's Day sad and alone.\n\nThis year, I'm just sad.\n\nWhat is it about this holiday that makes people so unhappy?\n\nI know.\n\nI hate myself most of the time, but tonight's the night\n\nI know everyone else does, too.\n\nI think you're cool.\n\nGreat.\n\nI got to tell you, we've got to stop beating ourselves up like this.\n\nExcuse me, everybody.\n\nCan I have your attention, please?\n\nWe're all here tonight because... we have no one to be with.\n\nBut... that doesn't make us mutants.\n\nThe only mutants here are in these comic books.\n\nWe've got to stop defining our self-worth by whether or not we're in a relationship.\n\nYou know what I see when I look around?\n\nI see a room full of great people.\n\nSo let's give ourselves a break.\n\nWe are a community, and as long as we have each other, we're never truly alone.\n\nThat was cool.\n\nWhat you said.\n\nYou really think so?\n\nYeah, I do.\n\nThank you.\n\nUh...\n\nWould you like to, uh... get a cup... a cup of coffee or...?\n\nOkay.\n\nLater, losers!\n\nHello?\n\nAnother medical emergency?\n\nWhat's wrong with him now?\n\nI seriously doubt he was bitten by a Chinese bird spider.\n\nHow exactly does a bump feel Asian?\n\nJust put him on the phone.\n\nSheldon, I am not driving over there again.\n\nBecause I drove over there yesterday for a brain tumor that turned out to be an ice cream headache.\n\nYes, I still want to be your emergency contact.\n\nYes, you can eat your ice cream too fast and also have a brain tumor.\n\nI'm on my way.\n\nBrain tumor would explain a lot. == sync, corrected by elderman ==\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "e71313df-1518-44e0-a132-a2967fb3da4c": {"__data__": {"id_": "e71313df-1518-44e0-a132-a2967fb3da4c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "2aa53893b2f4583167393ceb3bcad1b7aeb08d9d409feb2b53929426697912b1", "text": "  \ufeff1\n\nCan I have your attention, please?\n\nWe're all here tonight because we have no one to be with.\n\nWe've got to stop defining our self-worth by whether or not we're in a relationship.\n\nWe are a community, and as long as we have each other, we're never truly alone.\n\nThat was cool.\n\nWhat you said.\n\nThank you.\n\nUh... would you like to, uh... get a cup... a cup of coffee...?\n\nOkay.\n\nLater, losers!\n\nSo then I went to Cambridge, which was wonderful not only because it's a good school but because it totally looks like Hogwarts.\n\nThat's where I fell in love with astronomy, and now I'm an astrophysicist at Caltech, so I guess you could say, uh,\n\nRaj is my name and stars are my game.\n\nAnd rhyming is also my game.\n\nSo, uh, two games.\n\nUh, anyway, that-that's enough about me.\n\nI want to hear everything about you.\n\nI have to go to the bathroom.\n\nI go to the bathroom, too.\n\nSometimes more frequently than I care to admit.\n\nOh, I've had it checked out, it's nothing.\n\nHmm!

Penny.\n\nPenny.\n\nOh yeah, much better.\n\nWhat?\n\nAmy pointed out to me that since you did something nice for me,\n\nI'm obligated to do something nice for you.\n\nSo... yes, I'll go to your dopey play.\n\nHey, I don't want you to go anymore.\n\nWhy not?\n\nYou should go 'cause you want to go, not because you have to.\n\nOh, Dear Lord, more rules?\n\nWhere does it stop?\n\nCan I want to go because I have to want to go?\n\nOkay. Do whatever you want.\n\nYeah, but now, wait.\n\nDo whatever I want... or whatever I have to want?\n\nOh, for God's sake, just come to the play.\n\nAll right.\n\nI don't want to, but at least that makes sense.\n\nYou know, I haven't seen\n\nRaj in several days.\n\nIs he no longer a part of our social group?\n\nAnd if so, should we be interviewing for a replacement?\n\nPerhaps, this time, we go Latin.\n\nHe's just decided he's never leaving his apartment again.\n\nOh, brilliant.\n\nI've been itching to pull that trigger.\n\nHe's upset because he can't get anywhere with women.\n\nWould it help if I gave him some pointers?\n\nI'm just funnin' ya.\n\nHi.\n\nI don't know if you remember me, but I was here the other night at your party.\n\nOh, yeah, you left with Raj.\n\nUh, yeah.\n\nYou're the one?\n\nOkay, let me tell you something.\n\nThat guy you blew off happens to be my best friend.\n\nOkay?\n\nHe was devastated.\n\nSorry.\n\nCan you just give him this?\n\nOkay.\n\nBut I gotta warn you,\n\nRaj is a proud, passionate man.\n\nIf you go running out on him again, you're only gonna get, like, three or four more chances before you are history.\n\nCome on, she came back.\n\nThis is good news.\n\nYou should celebrate.\n\nI don't want to celebrate.\n\nNot even a little?\n\nI mean... we could have a pants party.\n\nGo put some on.\n\nWhy would I want her number?\n\nI don't want anything to do with this woman.\n\nOh, come on, Raj...\n\nNo, you don't get it.\n\nI want nothing to do with any woman.\n\nMy heart is stone.\n\nFrom now on, I'm a monk.\n\nI renounce all worldly pleasures.\n\nExcept for lobster.\n\nAnd garlic butter.\n\nBoy, I want to tell you it's her loss, but you are not making it easy.\n\nYou're-you're a good friend for trying to help, but...\n\nI've made my choice.\n\nAll right.\n\nWell, I'll see you around.\n\nSee you.\n\nOh, wait-- take her number.\n\nI don't want the temptation.\n\nOkay.\n\nI must be strong so I don't stray from my true purpose: the study of the universe.\n\nAll right.\n\nThanks for ruining lobster for me.\n\nWait!\n\nGive me the number!\n\nGive me the number!\n\nGive me the number!\n\nSo, Amy, what's going on with your addiction study?\n\nSadly, I'm no longer associated with that project.\n\nWhy? What happened?\n\nTypical bureaucratic nonsense.\n\nYou can get animals addicted to a harmful substance, you can dissect their brains, but you throw their own feces back at them and suddenly you're \"unprofessional.\"\n\nI'm sorry... ...that I asked.\n\nAll right, let's get this stupid play over with.\n\nUh, hang on.\n\nEmpty your pockets.\n\nWhy?\n\nYou know why.\n\nThe Nintendo DS.\n\nAnd the PSP.\n\nNow the Gameboy.\n\nAw, for Pete's sake.\n\nCan we go now?\n\nWell, is that all of it?\n\nJust set it down.\n\nJust so you know, this is not a stupid play. is an American classic.\n\nIt's about streetcars?\n\nOh, great.

Look, the letter was found in Bernadette's closet.\n\nDoesn't that count for something?\n\nAre you pointing out that California is a community property state, and since Howard and Bernadette are married, the intellectual property contained in that letter is jointly owned by the two spouses?\n\nYeah, obviously.\n\nWell played.\n\nSometimes I don't give you enough credit, Penny.\n\nDude, you made the right choice coming to me for help with this party.\n\nActually, all I did was invite you.\n\nWell, put your mind at ease.\n\nI'm here to make sure your dinner party kicks Howard's dinner party's ass.\n\nNow, the first thing we need is a theme.\n\nI'm thinking... ah, turn-of-the-century\n\nMoulin Rouge.\n\nI'm thinking you need a testosterone patch.\n\nPenny and I just want to do something low-key.\n\nYou know, cocktails, light jazz music, hors d'oeuvres.\n\nSo your theme is \"I saw a rerun of Mad Men and bought some crab puffs from Trader Joe's\"?\n\nHate to miss that.\n\nHey, where have you been?\n\nOh, Leonard.\n\nIf I was prone to sarcasm,\n\nI'd say I was pulling off a major heist at the museum of laundry baskets.\n\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.\n\nI meant, \"Golly, Sheldon, you've been gone a long time.\"\n\nOh. Yeah, well, I was waylaid by Penny, Bernadette and Amy.\n\nThey made me reveal confidential information about Howard's father.\n\nWhat information?\n\nI can't tell you that.\n\nI am bound by closet organizer/ organizee confidentiality.\n\nWell, come on, we won't tell anyone.\n\nSorry, badgering me won't work.\n\nWhat you should have said is, \"It's pointless to keep this a secret because Penny will tell us.\"\n\nFine, then that.\n\nAll right, I'll tell you.\n\nMy goodness, everyone's on their game today.\n\nThis is really fun.\n\nYeah, it's nice to get dressed up once in a while.\n\nYeah, and hors d'oeuvres are delightful.\n\nAs is the company.\n\nAw.\n\nMy shirt is itchy and I wish I were dead.\n\nHey, uh, listen, everybody.\n\nBefore Howard gets here, let's all just agree to not bring up the letter from his father.\n\nOf course.\n\nSure. Absolutely.\n\nIf I say yes, can we turn off that Latin orgy music?\n\nRidiculous that we still have to walk up all these flights of stairs.\n\nYeah, try doing it in heels.\n\nI am.\n\nWait.\n\nThere's something\n\nI have to tell you.\n\nWhat?\n\nI know what was in your dad's letter.\n\nSheldon, I swear to God,\n\nI'm gonna kill you!\n\nHey!\n\nI made him tell us.\n\nWhat? \"Us\"?\n\nWho else knows?\n\nI know.\n\nMe, too.\n\nSame here.\n\nShame on all of you.\n\nYou know, too.\n\nCouldn't leave him with one friend, could you?\n\nSo everybody knows what's in that letter except for me?\n\nYes, it's six against one.\n\nStand down, sir.\n\nHow could you do this?\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nIf you want, we could tell you.\n\nNo, I don't want to know!\n\nI mean,\n\nI do, but...\n\nI got to go.\n\nUsed me as a human shield?\n\nI panicked.\n\nHe looked taller than usual.\n\nHoward?\n\nIn here.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nI should have left it alone.\n\nIt's okay.\n\nSorry I ran off like that.\n\nWhat are you looking at?\n\nUh, pictures of my dad and me when I was a kid.\n\nThat's nice.\n\nI got to tell you, as angry as I am at Sheldon for blabbing, he did a hell of a job organizing this closet.\n\nLook at this. \"Photos of Wolowitz family before father left forever.\"\n\nCheck out nine-year-old Howie with cornrows.\n\nNeither race was happy to see me with those.\n\nThink you could take a break?\n\nWhy?\n\nGot a little surprise for you.\n\nCome on.\n\nOh, honey...\n\nI am in no mood to have sex tonight.\n\nI'll lay there if you absolutely have to have it, but... Oh.\n\nWhat are you guys doing here?\n\nWhen you left, you weren't sure whether or not you wanted to know what was in your dad's letter, so we came up with kind of a cool solution.\n\nOh, yeah, what's that?\n\nIt's simple, really.\n\nIt occurred to me that knowing and not knowing can be achieved by creating a macroscopic example of quantum superposition.\n\nThe-the principle that a physical system exists partially in all its possible states at once.\n\nWe were all thinking it, really.\n\nIt was kind of the elephant in the room, so...\n\nAnyway, um, I realize if we each present you with an account of what your father wrote to you, only one of which is true, and then we don't tell you which one it is, you will forever be in a state of epistemic ambivalence.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd I said if it wasn't epistemic, we might as well not do it.\n\nSit down, honey.\n\nRaj, you're up.\n\nOkay, um...\n\nIt was a card for your 18th birthday.\n\nInside it said, \"Happy birthday, Howard.\n\nI love you. Dad.\"\n\nOh, and it was a Far Side card, the one where the frog has its tongue stuck to the underside of an airplane.\n\nThinks it's a fly.\n\nSilly frog.\n\nSo funny.\n\nSheldon.\n\nIt was a map leading to the lost treasure of famous pirate One-Eyed Willy.\n\nNice try.\n\nThat's the plot for Goonies.\n\nTold you.\n\nDon't.\n\nAmy.\n\nYou didn't know it, but your father was in the auditorium at your high school graduation.\n\nAnd he cried because he was so proud of you.\n\nReally?\n\nOr that's complete poppycock which Amy made up.\n\nIt still could be the map.\n\nPenny.\n\nIt was a letter explaining that your dad wasn't who he said he was.\n\nEventually, his other life caught up to him, and the only way to keep you and your mom safe was to leave.\n\nI would like to change mine.\n\nThe pirate's name was Peg-Leg Antoine.\n\nNow it's completely different from Goonies.\n\nNo, it's not.\n\nDon't.\n\nOkay, my turn.\n\nYour dad wrote about how family is the most important thing, and that you should never throw it away like he did.\n\nHmm.\n\nBernadette.\n\nInside the envelope was a picture of your dad holding you the day you were born.\n\nOn the back he wrote, \"Howard, my son, my greatest gift.\"\n\nYou okay?\n\nYeah.\n\nI'm terrific.\n\nSo...?\n\nWhich one do you think it is... matey?\n\nActually, I don't want to know.\n\nI... want all of them to be true.\n\nWell, one of them is.\n\nThat's pretty cool.\n\nThank you, guys.\n\nHey, it's still early.\n\nWhy don't we go back and have that party?\n\nYeah, cool.\n\nOkay? Good.\n\nYou know, surprisingly, uh, the letter from your father wasn't the most interesting thing\n\nI read in the closet.\n\nBernadette's diary has some saucy passages.\n\nSheldon, don't you dare!\n\nTh-There's nothing to worry about.\n\nYour secret's safe with me.\n\nThat's more like it.\n\nAlthough copyright law would allow me to quote snippets in the context of a review.\n\nGlad you're feeling better.\n\nMe, too.\n\nIf I'd known we were gonna be dancing, would have worn my flats.\n\nThis turned out pretty well, huh?\n\nYeah, I think so.\n\nI agree.\n\nThat is, if you've never been to or heard of a party before.\n\nIf you'd let me pierce your brain with a hot needle in the right place, you'd be happy all the time.\n\nUh, Penny,\n\nI-I have a couple of questions about your closet.\n\nIs there any reason you're keeping this dead goldfish?\n\nDamn, I forgot to feed him.\n\nAnd that I had him.\n\nWell, now, did you also have a dog?\n\nBecause I found what appears to be a battery-operated chew toy.\n\nParty's over!\n\nParty's over! == sync, corrected by elderman ==\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "2b6fd5d0-a102-4bd4-9bca-b78bbc766868": {"__data__": {"id_": "2b6fd5d0-a102-4bd4-9bca-b78bbc766868", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "e9cee5584547c84ab731bddcb294fb8cc570ddf5aa9ad3ebd4c409a8ee3d7252", "text": "  \ufeff1\n\nI was reading about this jellyfish that never dies.\n\nInstead, it reverts to its asexual state and then grows up again.\n\nWe thought my 90-year-old grandfather had reverted to an asexual state, but the lawsuit from his Jamaican caregiver proved us all wrong.\n\nMy point is, immortality is not only a possibility, it is real.\n\nOnly if you're this jellyfish which periodically reverts to a mass of undifferentiated protoplasm.\n\nIf I could keep my Gmail account,\n\nI'd be okay with that.\n\nHello, fellas.\n\nHey.\n\nRemember when we were trying to figure out what that smell coming from Professor\n\nTupperman's office was?\n\nYeah?\n\nTurns out it was Tupperman.\n\nDead at his desk for two weeks.\n\nOh, my God.\n\nThat's terrible.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the department chair is asking that everyone donate a bottle of Febreze.\n\nIf we're going to change the topic from jellyfish,\n\nI'd be okay with brine shrimp or the history of the unicycle.\n\nShow a little compassion-- a man died.\n\nAnd turned into a puddle of goo.\n\nNow, we can either sit around and cry over spilt professor, or... we can rejoice in the knowledge that a tenured position has just opened up.\n\nI choose to do the latter.\n\nExcuse me, the whole tenure system is ridiculous.\n\nA guaranteed job for life only encourages the faculty to become complacent.\n\nIf we really want science to advance, people should have chips implanted in their skulls that explode when they say something stupid.\n\nWell, I believe people do their best work when they feel safe and secure.\n\nIf you need my nose, you'll find it firmly lodged up the rectum of the tenure committee.\n\nYou Ph.D's gonna go suck up like Kripke?\n\nNo.\n\nI mean, I'll apply, but I'm not gonna stoop to playing politics.\n\nYeah, me neither.\n\nIt should be about the work.\n\nAnd if I can't get tenure,\n\nI'd like to see you or Sheldon get it.\n\nRaj, don't dangle false hope in front of Leonard like that.\n\nExcuse me, but I think I'm just as qualified as you are. \u266a Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \u266a \u266a Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started...

Sorry, I thought you were gonna do that...\n\nThe love spell takes effect.\n\nWhen Sheldon looks at Amy, she is the most beautiful half-orc he's ever seen, and he's overcome with a desire to rip her armor off and gaze fondly at her four hairy breasts.\n\nWhen Amy sees Sheldon, he looks... well, just like Sheldon, 'cause apparently she's into that.\n\nWhat do you do?\n\nI don't like this.\n\nYou see what happens when you let girls play D & D?\n\nAmy.\n\nAmy.\n\nAmy.\n\nWhat?\n\nI've never knocked on my own door before.\n\nThat was a wild ride.\n\nYou don't have to come in here and cheer me up.\n\nThank you.\n\nWould you go tell everyone else that?\n\nBecause they sure think otherwise.\n\nI'll tell you what they think.\n\nThey think our relationship is a joke.\n\nWell, I don't think our relationship is a joke.\n\nI think \"a horse goes into a bar, bartender says, 'Why the long face?'\"\n\nThat's a joke.\n\nIt's a good one, too, because a horse has a long face.\n\nSheldon, are we ever going to have an intimate relationship?\n\nOh, my.\n\nThat's an uncomfortable topic.\n\nAmy... fore I met you,\n\nI never had any interest in being intimate with anyone.\n\nAnd now?\n\nAnd now what?\n\nDo you have any interest now?\n\nI have not ruled it out.\n\nWow.\n\nTalk dirty to me.\n\nI know it doesn't seem like it to you, but, for me, what we have is extremely intimate.\n\nI guess I know that.\n\nIt's just... part of me wants more.\n\nMore?\n\nI mean, look at us.\n\nIt's only been three years; here we are in bed together.\n\nCome on.\n\nLet's go back out there.\n\nY... Well, no.\n\nHold on.\n\nMy Elven magic-user and your half-orc warrior did have a love spell cast on them.\n\nWe wouldn't really be playing the game right if we didn't see that through.\n\nOkay.\n\nI believe that, uh, we just killed a dragon.\n\nWhile the others pillage the corpse,\n\nI lead you to a secluded area where I attempt to remove your leather armor.\n\nIt comes off.\n\nOh.\n\nWhat do you do?\n\nI... ...kiss you... on the lips.\n\nI kiss you back on the... ...lips as well.\n\nYour turn.\n\nI... remove your armor.\n\nWhat do you do?\n\nI... erotically caress your... ...nose.\n\nKeep rolling.\n\nHey, you guys have been in there for a while.\n\nYou doing okay?\n\nWe're fine, thank you.\n\nOkay, we just want to say, we feel really bad about...\n\nGo away!
